But for  other\nnon-Madhya  Bharat  students the capitation  fee  should  be\nretained as at present at Rs. 1,300 for nominees and at\t Rs.\n1,500 for others\".\nBona fide resident' for the purpose of this rule was defined\nas: one who is-\n (a) a citizen of India whose original domicile is in Madhya\nBharat,provided he has not acquired a domicile elsewhere, or\n(b)  a\tcitizen of India, whose original domicile is not  in\nMadhya\tBharat\tbut who has acquired a\tdomicile  in  Madhya\nBharat\tand has resided there for not less than 5  years  at\nthe date, on which he applies for admission, or\n(c)a person who migrated from Pakistan before September\t 30,\n1948 intends to reside in Madhya Bharat permanently, or\n  (d) a person or class of persons or citizens of an area or\nterritory adjacent to Madhya -Bharat or to India in  respect\nof whom or which a Declaration of Eligibility has been\tmade\nby the Madhya Bharat Government\".\nThe   question\tfor  determination  was\t whether  the\trule\ninfringed the fundamental rights guaranteed by Arts. 14\t and\n15(1) of the Constitution.\nHeld, per VFNKATARAMA AYYAR J. (MUKHERJEA C.J., VIVIAN\tBosE\nand SINHA JJ. concurring, JAGANNADHADAS J. dissenting)\tthat\nthe  rule did not infringe the fundamental right  guaranteed\nby  Art. 15(1) because residence and place of birth are\t two\ndistinct conceptions with different connotations both in law\nand  in fact, and when Art. 15(1)  prohibits  discrimination\nbased  on  the\tplace  of  birth,  it  cannot  be  read\t  as\nprohibiting discrimination based on residence.\n156\n1216\nDomicile  of a person means big permanent home and is  some-\ntimes used in the sense of residence.\nHeld further, that the imposition of capitation fee on\tsome\nof the students and not on others was not discriminatory  as\nbeing  in  contravention  of Art. 14  of  the  Constitution,\nbecause the classification was based on a ground which had a\nreasonable relation to the subject matter of the legislation\nas the object of the classification underlying the  impugned\nrule  was  clearly to help to some extent students  who\t are\nresidents  of  Madhya  Bharat in the  prosecution  of  their\nstudies\t and it was quite a laudable object for a  State  to\nencourage education - within its borders.  A  classification\nmade  on  a geographical basis would be eminently  just\t and\nreasonable when it relates to education which is the concern\nprimarily of the State.\n     Per  JAGANNADHADAS\t J.-There is no place  for  regional\ndomicile  in the existing Indian Law.  In the  circumstances\nthe phrase     original domicile in Madhya Bharat\" is  meant\nto  convey the \"Place of birth (of the applicant) in  Madhya\nBharat\".  It is true that \"domicile of origin\" and \"place of\nbirth\"\tare  two different, matters.  But that\tis  so\tonly\nwhere  the use of the phrase \"domicile of origin\" conveys  a\ndefinite  legal meaning.  In the present case  however,\t the\nphrase\t\"domicile  of origin in Madhya\tBharat\"\t conveys  no\nlegal meaning, and if any meaning has to be attached to\t it,\nthen it could only have reference to the,\"places of birth\".\nTherefore,  the rule in question has reference to  place  of\nbirth in Madhya Bharat primarily, and offends Art. 15 of the\nConstitution.  Even in the view that the rule has  reference\nto  the juristic concept of regional domicile and  for\tthat\nreason\tdoes not fall within the scope of the inhibition  of\nArt. 15, a distinction based on such domicile cannot, in any\nway,  be considered reasonable with reference to Art. 14  of\nthe Constitution.\nBitstam\t Mody v.

The principal element in s. 34  of\nthe  Indian Penal Code is the common intention to  commit  a\ncrime.\tIn furtherance of the common intention several\tacts\nmay  be done by several persons resulting in the  commission\nof that crime.\tIn such a situation s. 34 provides that each\none  of\t them  would be liable for that crime  in  the\tsame\nmanner\tas if all the acts resulting in that crime had\tbeen\ndone by him alone.  There is no question of common intention\nin  s.\t149  of the Indian Penal Code.\tAn  offence  may  be\ncommitted by a member of an unlawful assembly and the  other\nmembers\t will be liable for that offence although there\t was\nno  common  intention  between that  person  and  the  other\nmembers\t of  the unlawful assembly to  commit  that  offence\nprovided  the  conditions  laid\t down  in  the\tsection\t are\nfulfilled.  Thus if the offence committed by that person  is\nin prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly\nor such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to\nbe  committed  in prosecution of the  common  object,  every\nmember\tof  the unlawful assembly would be  guilty  of\tthat\noffence,  although there may have been no  common  intention\nand  no\t participation by the other members  in\t the  actual\ncommission of that offence.\nThere  is  a difference between object\tand  intention,\t for\nalthough  the  object may be common, the intentions  of\t the\nseveral\t members  of the unlawful assembly  may\t differ\t and\nindeed\tmay be similar only in one respect namely that\tthey\nare  all  -unlawful, while the element of  participation  in\naction,\t which is the leading feature of s. 34, is  replaced\nin  s. 149 by membership of the assembly at the time of\t the\ncommitting of the offence.\nA  charge  for a substantive offence under section  302,  or\nsection 325 of the Indian Penal Code, etc. is for a distinct\nand separate offence from that under section 302, read\twith\nsection 149 or section 325, read with section 149, etc.\nA person charged with an offence read with s. 149 cannot  be\nconvicted  of  the substantive offence\twithout\t a  specific\ncharge\tbeing  framed as required by s. 233 of the  Code  of\nCriminal Procedure.\nThere was no room for the application of s. 236 of the\tCode\nof Criminal Procedure to the facts of the present case.\nThe  provisions of s. 236 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure\ncan  apply only in cases where there is no doubt  about\t the\nfacts which can be proved but a doubt arises as to which  of\nseveral offences have been committed on the proved facts  in\nwhich case any number of charges can be framed and tried  or\nalternative  charges  can be framed.  In  the  present\tcase\nthere  was  no doubt about the facts and if  the  allegation\nagainst the appellant that he had caused the injuries to the\ndeceeased with takwa was established by evidence, then there\ncould  be  no  doubt that the offence  of  murder  had\tbeen\ncommitted,\n\t\t\t    1203\nIn  the\t present case there was no question  of\t any  error,\nomission  or irregularity, in the charge within the  meaning\nof  s.\t537  of the Code of Criminal  Procedure\t because  no\ncharge\tunder  s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code was  in\tfact\nframed.\nThere  was  an\tillegality in the present case\tand  not  an\nirregularity which was curable by the provisions of ss.\t 535\nand 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  Assuming however\nthat there was merely an irregularity which was curable, the\nirregularity  in  the  circumstances of\t the  case  was\t not\ncurable\t because the appellant was misled in his defence  by\nthe  absence  of a charge under s. 302 of the  Indian  Penal\nCode.\nBy  framing a charge under s. 302, read with s. 149,  Indian\nPenal  Code against the appellant, the Court indicated\tthat\nit was not charging the appellant with the offence of murder\nand to convict him for murder and sentence him under s.\t 302\nof  the Indian Penal Code was to convict him of\t an  offence\nwith  which he had not been charged.  In  defending  himself\nthe appellant was not called upon to meet such a charge\t and\nin his defence he may well have considered it unnecessary to\nconcentrate on that part of the prosecution ease.\nBarendra  Kumar\t Ghosh v.

Encumbered Estates Act, E. E. Act Case No. 11 of 1936 and the other a title suit, being Regular Suit No. 71 of 1938 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Gonda in relation to a 10 annas share in the property left by one Bhaiya Baleshwar Datt Singh hereinafter referred to as the deceased.\n2. The deceased died on 15-5-1933 leaving him surviving Bhaiya Girja Datt Singh, hereinafter referred to as Girja, the original Appellant, as his nearest collateral and heir. Bhaiya Gangotri Datt Singh, hereinafter referred to as Gangotri, was a remoter heir but claimed to succeed to the estate of the deceased under the terms of a will alleged to have been made and published by the deceased on 17-3-1928. Girja filed 29 applications for mutation of his name in place of that of the deceased in the Revenue Courts in respect of the properties left by the deceased. Gangotri contested these applications on the basis of the said alleged will. All these cases were consolidated and the case with respect to the village Nagwa was treated as the main case.\nOn 14-11-1933 three applications were made to the Revenue Court for reference to arbitration of the disputes between Girja and Gangotri:\n (1) Application Ex. 58 by Gangotri under Section 203, U. P. Land Revenue Act\n \n\n(2)  Application  Ex.  57  by  Girja under Section 203 of the U. P. Land Revenue Act and\n \n\n(3) Joint application Ex. 59 by Girja and Gangotri, stating that they had appointed Bhaiya Raghuraj Singh and Bhaiya Lot Baksh Singh, Taluqdars of Majhgawan as arbitrators and that whatever award would be given by the said arbitrators in respect of the property left by the deceased would be accepted by the parties and both the parties would abide by the same and that mutation might also be made according to the award. By an order dated 15-11-1933 the Revenue Court referred the matters to the arbitration of the said arbitrators. Gangotri tried to resile from the reference but ultimately the Board of Revenue held him bound by the reference.\nThe arbitrators published their award on 17-1-1934 in the terms following:\n \"We decide that out of the entire property of Baleshwar Datt Singh, only ten annas share out of the entire villages be given to Bhaiya Girja Datt Singh and six annas to Bhaiya Gangotri Datt Singh. The waqf property shall remain as such and Bhaiya Girja Datt Singh shall continue to be its mutwalli. The parties, their heirs and representatives shall be bound by the award generation after generation. The said award shall be binding on the parties in the revenue and civil courts.\"\nGangotri filed objections to the said award contending that the reference was not made by him by free consent, that the arbitrators had exceeded their powers and that the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct. By its judgment dated 18-1-1935 the Revenue Court rejected the objections and ordered mutations in terms of the award. An appeal by Gangotri against this order and   judgment  was   dismissed  on 14-5-1935.\n3. On 11-4-1936 Girja filed an application under Section 4, U. P. Encumbered Estates Act, E. E. Act Case No. 11 of 1936 for the liquidation of his debts. In the written statement dated 21-5-1936 filed under Section 8 of the Act the ten annas share in the properties left by the deceased was shown as belonging to Girja and as liable for the satisfaction of his debts. On 22-5-1937 Gangotri filed objections under Section 11 of the Act claiming the said properties as his own under the will dated 17-3-1928, alleged to have been executed by the deceased in his favour. On 18-5-1937 Gangotri filed Regular Suit No. 71 of 1938 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Gonda against Girja for recovery of possession of the 10 annas share of the properties left by the deceased and held by Girja under the terms of the award. Gangotri based his claim on the terms of the said will and contended that he was entitled to all the properties left by the deceased as the sole legatee. Girja resisted the suit mainly on two grounds, viz., (1) that the will Ex. A. 36 was not duly executed and attested, and (2) that the award which amounted to a family settlement was binding upon the parties.\n4. Issue No. 6 in E. E. Act Case No. 11 of 1936:--\"Is the Rent Court's decision about the award 'res judicata' and does no civil suit lie?\" was tried as a preliminary issue and by his judgment dated 5-5-1938 the Special Judge held that the question as to the validity or invalidity of the award was 'res judicata' but a civil suit was not barred by reason of the decision of the Revenue Court. An appeal against this judgment was dismissed by the Chief Court of Oudh on 22-7-1942.\n5. The E. E. Act Case No. 11 of 1936 and the Regular Suit No. 71 of 1938 were thereafter tried and heard and disposed of together, the learned advocates of the parties having agreed that the result of the suit should follow the result of the E. E. Act case: The Special Judge found that the will was proved to have been duly executed and attested, that the reference to arbitration was made by Gangotri of his own free will and he could not withdraw therefrom, that the award was not vitiated by fraud or partiality of the arbitrators, that the award did not amount to a family settlement and that it not being registered could not be used in the Civil Court. The claim of Gangotri was accordingly allowed and the properties in question were held not to belong to Girja. Following the said findings the Civil Judge decreed Suit No. 71 of 1938 in favour of Gangotri.\n6. Girja preferred two appeals to the Chief Court of Oudh against these two decrees. The Chief Court of Oudh by its judgment dated 28-2-1947 dismissed both the appeals. Girja applied to the Chief Court of Oudh on 2-4-1947 for leave to appeal to the Privy Council but the same was refused on 12-8-1947. He thereupon applied to the Federal Court for special leave to appeal against the judgment and decree of the Chief Court of Oudh and by its orders dated 11-11-1948 the Federal Court granted special leave to appeal in both the matters. It is only necessary to state that Girja died on 5-11-1949 and the present Appellants were substituted in his place and stead as his heirs and legal representatives on 9-3-1951.\n7. The two questions which arise in these appeals are (1) whether the will dated 17-3-1928 is proved to have been duly executed and attested and (2) whether the award published by the arbitrators on 17-1-1934 is binding on the parties. As our decision on the first question is determinative of these appeals we have not found it necessary to call upon the parties to argue the second question before us. We are of the opinion that the will dated 17-3-1928 is not proved to have been duly executed and attested and the Appellants are therefore entitled to succeed.\n8. The facts in regard to the due execution and attestation of the will may be shortly Stated as under. The deceased was a resident of the village of Nagwa Khas, Pargana Mahadeva, Tahsil Tarabganj, District Gonda. Prior to 17-3-1928 he had duly made and published two wills dated 27-8-1904 and 1-12-1915 and those wills were executed by him, when his wife was living. But she died after the execution of his second will and Gangotri, a distant relation of his became a member of his household when quite young somewhere in 1923. The deceased intended to execute a will in favour of Gangotri some time in March 1928. He also wanted to execute a deed of waqf dedicating 1.66 acres of land in Tehsil Tarabganj in favour of certain idols which he had installed in a Thakurdwara at the village Nagwa.\nWith that intention he came to Gonda on or about 15-3-1928 and put up at the Math of Mahant Gulabgir in Gonda. One Gur Charan Lal, a pleader of Gonda was his legal adviser and he approached Gur Charan Lal for the drafting of his will. Gur Charan Lal prepared a rough draft of the will on or about 16-3-1928, and the said rough draft was made fair and was scribed by Sant Bux, a clerk of Gur Charan Lal at the latter's place of residence on the morning of 17-3-1928. It appears that a fair draft of the deed of waqf was also prepared and scribed by one Hasinuddin on the morning of 16-3-1928 and the case of Gangotri was that both these fair drafts after having been scribed as aforesaid were taken by the deceased to Tarabganj and were executed by the deceased and duly attested by the attesting witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh under a Bargad tree in the compound of the registration office at Tarabganj.\nAfter the execution and attestation of these documents they were on the same day presented for registration by the deceased before the Sub-Registrar at Gonda. The deceased admitted execution and completion of the said two documents and was identified before the Sub-Registrar by two persons, one Mahadev Pershad and the other Nageshur. Mahadeo Pershad and Nageshur appended their signatures under those of the Sub-Registrar at the foot of the endorsement in regard to registration.\n9. In order to prove the due execution and attestation of the will Gangotri examined the two witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh. Girja examined Hasinuddin, the scribe of the deed of 'waqf'. The will Ex. A. 36 was scribed in blue ink and the signatures of the deceased and the two attesting witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh were also made in the same ink. The deed of waqf, Ex. A. 23 on the other hand was scribed in black ink and the signatures of the deceased and the attesting witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh were also made in the same black ink.\nThe evidence of Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh was that though both the documents had been scribed at Gonda they were not executed and attested at Gonda because Uma Dutt Singh, who was intended by the deceased to be an attesting witness to both the documents was not present in Gonda on 17-3-192$ and therefore the deceased asked Badri Singh, who was at Gonda on that day to accompany him to Tarabganj and both the documents were executed by the deceased and were duly attested by the two attesting witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh under the Bargad tree in the compound of the registration office at Tarabganj.\nUma Dutt Singh further stated in his evidence that he was at the village Karimpur for about 7 or 8 days before 17-3-1928, that a letter addressed by the deceased to him at his village Rampur Karehta was received by him at Karimpur and he managed an elephant and reached Tarabganj registration office at about 2 P. M. on 17-3-1928 where he found assembled the deceased, Badri Singh and six or seven other persons. It was after Uma Dutt Singh thus reached the Tarabganj registration office that it was alleged that both the documents Ex. A. 23 and Ex. A. 36 were executed by the deceased .and duly attested by Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh as aforesaid, one after the other and were after due execution and attestation thereof presented by the deceased before the Sub-Registrar between 2 and 3 P. M. that day.\n10. Hasinuddin on the other hand deposed that he scribed the fair draft of the deed of waqf at the house of Gur Charan Lal at Gonda, that the deceased and the two attesting witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh were present at the house of Gur Charan Lal and Ex. A. 23 was duly executed by the deceased and attested by the said attesting witnesses at the house of Gur Charan Lal in his presence. He had brought his ink pot and the pen with him and the fair draft was scribed by him and was also executed and duly attested by the deceased and the attesting witnesses in the same ink which was black ink. At the time when he was scribing the fair draft of the deed of waqf he also saw Sant Bux scribing a fair draft of some document but he did not know what that document was.\nIf the version of Hasinuddin as regards the due execution and attestation of the deed of waqf, Ex. A. 23 was correct, the two attesting witnesses examined by Gangotri, viz., Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh. were obviously telling a lie when they stated that both the documents, Ex. A. 23 and Ex. A. 36 were duly executed and attested under the Bargad tree in the compound of the registration office at Tarabganj. It may be noted that Gur Charan Lal who was examined by Gangotri disavowed all connection with Ex. A. 23 but only deposed to the preparation and the scribing of the will, Ex. A. 36 and the deceased having taken away the fair draft to Tarabganj for execution and completion of the document.\n11. The trial Court believed Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh and observed that in spite of very lengthy cross-examination nothing was elicited from them which could vitiate the registered will. As regards the difference in the inks with which Exs. A. 23 and A. 36 were scribed, executed and attested it observed that similar pens and inks to those which were used in Ex. A. 23 could be had at Tarabganj and therefore discarded the evidence of Hasinuddin that Ex. A-23 was executed and attested at Gonda.\nThe Chief Court of Oudh on the other hand stressed the difference in the inks on the two documents, Ex. A. 23 and Ex. A. 36 and opined that the statement of Hasinuddin that Ex. A. 23 was completed, signed and attested in his presence at Gonda might as well be true and concluded that the attesting witnesses were not telling the truth when they gave the reason why the will, Ex. A. 36 was not signed and attested at Gonda. It however accepted the evidence of the attesting witnesses to the extent that they saw the deceased sign Ex. A. 36 and that they also signed in his presence and thus agreed with the finding of the trial Court that the will Ex. A. 36 was duly executed and attested.\n12. We have ourselves seen the original documents Ex. A. 23 and Ex. A. 36 and agree with the conclusion reached by the Chief Court of Oudh that the attesting witnesses were not telling the truth when they gave the reason why the will was not signed and attested at Gonda. Hasinuddin was a petition writer and usually carried his own ink pot and pen. That ink pot contained black ink and he scribed the fair draft of Ex. A-23 in that black ink. A perusal of his evidence does not justify the criticism which has been leveled against him by the trial Court, viz., that he was a witness who could be purchased and was got up for the purpose of putting forward a false story that Ex. A-23 was executed and attested in the house of Gur Charan Lal at Gonda.\nHis evidence sounds quite natural and in spite of his poverty he does not appear to have been anxious to support the case of Girja as appears from the answer which he gave in cross-examination as regards the deceased being \"a sensible man\". The evidence of Hasinuddin accepted as it is by the Chief Court of Oudh goes to establish that the deed of waqf Ex. A-23 was scribed by him and was executed by the deceased and attested by Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh in his presence at the house of Gur Charan Lal. If Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh were both present in Gonda at the time of the execution of Ex. A-23 it is impossible to believe that the will, Ex. A-36 also was not executed by the deceased and attested by Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh at the same time.\nThe ink with which the fair draft of the will, Ex. A-36 was scribed was blue ink which would be the ink in the ink pot of Gur Charan Lal and when Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh were both present at the time of the execution and attestation of the deed of waqf Ex. A-23 it is but natural that the deceased, after Sant Bux had scribed the fair draft of the will, executed the same and the attesting witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh also attested the execution thereof at Gonda. That would explain the execution and attestation of the attesting witnesses in the same ink with which the fair draft of the will was scribed by Sant Bux.\nThe story which has been deposed to by Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh in regard to the execution and attestation of both the documents, Ex. A-23 and Ex. A-36 under the Bargad tree in the compound of the registration office at Tarabganj cannot be believed for the simple reason that if both these documents had been executed and attested there it is impossible to understand how the scribing, the execution and the attestation of each of these documents happens to be uniformly in different inks. Uma Dutt Singh had admitted in his statement before the Assistant Collector in the mutation case that there was one ink pot at Tarabganj when he reached the Tarabganj registration office and this statement of his was admitted by him to be correct, in the evidence which he gave before the trial Court.\nNone of these witnesses was able to explain the circumstances under which the execution and attestation of the deed of waqf, Ex. A-23 was in the same black ink with which the document was scribed and the execution and attestation of the will, Ex. A-36 was also in the same blue ink with which the document was scribed. These circumstances are in our opinion eloquent and go to show that not only was the deed of waqf, Ex. A-23 scribed, executed and attested at the house of Gur Charan Lal in the presence of Hasinuddin but the will, Ex. A-36 was also scribed and attested at the house of Gur Charan Lal and in the ink which was used by Sant Bux for scribing the fair draft of the will. But the attesting witnesses would not have the will Ex. A-36 executed and attested at Gonda.\n13. It was urged before us by the learned counsel for Gangotri that the conclusion reached by the Chief Court of Oudh in regard to the execution and attestation of the will, Ex. A. 36 at Gonda was correct and the two attesting witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh were guilty of a lapse of memory when they deposed that both the documents Ex. A-23 and Ex. A-36 were executed and attested at Tarabganj under the Bargad tree in the compound of the registration office at Tarabganj. This contention is in our opinion untenable. The theory as regards the lapse of memory is negatived by the details which have been given by these witnesses as to why both the documents had to be taken to Tarabganj for execution and attestation.\nBadri Singh stated that Uma Dutt Singh was not available at Gonda and he was the person desired by the deceased to be one of the attesting witnesses. Uma Dutt Singh also confirmed this statement that he was not at Gonda on that day but got the letter addressed by the deceased to him at Rampur Karehta in the village Karimpur and managed an elephant and reached the Tarabganj registration office at 2 P. M. on 17-3-1928. There is the further statement of both these witnesses that the documents Ex. A-23 and Ex. A-36 were in fact executed by the deceased and attested by them under the Bargad tree in the compound of the registration office at Tarabganj.\nAll these details far from supporting the theory of a lapse of memory on their part only go to show that they were inventing a story with the intention of lending an air of verisimilitude to it. Gur Charan Lal for some reason or the other did not want to be involved in the matter of the execution of the will Ex. A-36 and it appears that somehow or the other the two witnesses Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh were persuaded to depose that the execution and attestation of the will, Ex. A. 36 took place at Tarabganj and not at Gonda. We are of the opinion that the version given by Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh in regard to the execution and attestation of the will Ex. A-36 under the Bargad tree in the compound of the registration office at Tarabganj is an invention and the will, Ex. A-36 was scribed by Sant Bux at Gonda, was executed by the deceased at Gonda and Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh also appended their signatures to the same in token of attestation at Gonda.\nWe are supported in this conclusion of ours by the fact that the identification of the deceased before the Sub-Registrar \"at Tarabganj was made hot by Uma Putt Singh and Badri Singh who according to their own story were present in the registration office at Tarabganj but by two other individuals Mahadeo Pershad and Nageshur.\n14. It   still  remains   to   consider  whether the attestation of the signature of the deceased on the will, Ex. A-36 was in accordance with the requirements of Section  63, Indian Succession Act.    Section 63  prescribes that:\n \"(c) The  will  shall  be  attested  by two  or more witnesses, each of whom has seen the testator sign or affix his mark to the will or has seen some other person sign the will, in the presence and by the direction of the testator, or has received from the testator a personal   acknowledgment of his  signature or mark, or of the signature of such other person; and each of the witnesses shall sign the will in the presence of the testator ..............\"\nIn order to prove the due attestation of the will Ex. A-36 Gangotri would have to prove that Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh saw the deceased sign the will and they themselves signed the same in the presence of the deceased. The evidence of Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh is not such as to carry conviction in the mind of the Court that they saw the deceased sign the will and each of them appended his signature to the will in the presence of the deceased. They have been demonstrated to be witnesses who had no regard for truth and were ready and willing to oblige Gur Charan Lal in transferring the venue of the execution and attestation of the documents Ex. A-23 and Ex. A-36 from Gonda to Tarabganj for reasons best known to themselves.\nIf no reliance could thus be placed upon their oral testimony, where would be the assurance that they actually saw the deceased execute the will in their presence and each of them signed the will in the presence of the deceased. It may as well be that the signature of the deceased on the will was appended at one time, the deceased being there all alone by himself and the attestations were made by Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh at another time without having seen the deceased sign the will or when the deceased was not present when they appended their signatures thereto in token of attestation. We have no satisfactory evidence before us to enable us to come to the conclusion that the will was duly attested by Uma Dutt Singh and Badri Singh and we are therefore unable to hold that the will Ex. A-36 is proved to have been duly executed and attested.\n15. When this position was realised the learned counsel for Gangotri fell back on an alternative argument and it was that the deceased admitted execution and completion of the will Ex. A. 36 and acknowledged his signature thereto before the Sub-Registrar at Tarabganj and this acknowledgment of his signature was in the presence of the two persons who identified him before the Sub-Registrar, viz., Mahadeo Pershad and Nageshur who had in their turn appended their signatures at the foot of the endorsement by the Sub-Registrar. These signatures it was contended were enough to prove the due attestation of the will Ex. A. 36. This argument would have availed Gangotri if Mahadeo Pershad and Nageshur had appended their signatures at the foot of the endorsement of registration 'animo attestandi'.\nBut even apart from this circumstance it is significant that neither Mahadeo Pershad nor Nageshur was called as a witness to depose to the fact of such attestation if any. One could not presume from the mere signatures of Mahadeo Pershad and Nageshur appearing at the foot of the endorsement of registration that they had appended their signatures to the document as attesting witnesses or can be construed to have done so in their capacity as attesting witnesses. Section 68, Indian Evidence Act requires an attesting witness to be called as a witness to prove the due execution and attestation of the will. This provision should have been complied with in order that Mahadeo Pershad and Nageshur be treated as attesting witnesses. This line of argument therefore cannot help Gangotri.\n16. The result therefore is that the will dated 17-3-1928 is not proved to have been duly executed and attested and cannot furnish a basis of title to Gangotri in regard to the ten annas share in the properties left by the deceased, the subject-matter of the two proceedings E. E. Act Case No. 11 of 1936 and Regular Suit No. 71 of 1938 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Gonda. The appeals will therefore be allowed, the objections filed by Gangotri in E. E. Act Case No. 11 of 1936 will be dismissed and so also the Regular Suit No. 71 of 1938 in the Court of the Civil Judge, Gonda. Gangotri will pay to Girja and his heirs and legal representatives the present Appellants in these appeals the costs incurred by them in these proceedings throughout, in this Court as also in the Courts below.\n"}, {"id": "84946", "date": "1/1955", "tagline": "Mahant Salig Ram vs Musammat Maya Devi on 21 January, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nMAHANT SALIG RAM\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nMUSAMMAT MAYA DEVI.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n21/01/1955\n\nBENCH:\nDAS, SUDHI RANJAN\nBENCH:\nDAS, SUDHI RANJAN\nBHAGWATI, NATWARLAL H.\nIMAM, SYED JAFFER\n\nCITATION:\n 1955 AIR  266\t\t  1955 SCR  (5)1191\n\n\nACT:\nCustom-succession-Non-ancestral\t  property-Daughter   versus\ncollateral   within  fourth  degree-Saraswat   Brahmins\t  of\nPathankot  in the District  of\tGurdaspur-Biwaj-i-am-Entries\ntherein-Value  of -Riwaj-i-am of Gurdaspur District  of\t the\nyear  1913-Whether- a reliable document-Answer to  questions\n16 and 17-Value of.\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\nIt is now well-settled that the general custom of the Punjab\nbeing\tthat  a\t daughter  excludes  the  collaterals\tfrom\nsuccession  to the self-acquired property of her father\t the\ninitial\t onus,\ttherefore,  must, on principle,\t be  on\t the\ncollaterals to show that the general custom in favour of the\ndaughter's  succession to the self-acquired property of\t her\nfather\thas been varied by a special local custom  excluding\nthe daughter which is binding on the parties.\nIt  is\talso  well-settled that though the  entries  in\t the\nRiwaj-i-am are entitled to an initial presumption in  favour\nof their correctness irrespective of the question whether or\nnot  the custom, as recorded, is in accord with the  general\ncustom,\t the  quantum of evidence necessary  to\t rebut\tthat\npresumption   will,  however,  vary  with  the\t facts\t and\ncircumstances of each case.  Where, for instance, the Riwaj-\niam  lays  down\t a custom in  consonance  with\tthe  general\nagricultural custom of the province, very strong proof would\nbe required to displace that presumption; but where, on\t the\nother  hand,  the custom as recorded in\t the  Riwaj-i-am  is\nopposed\t to the custom generally prevalent, the\t presumption\nwill be considerably weakened, Likewise,\n1192\nwhere  the  Riwaj-i-am affects adversely the rights  of\t the\nfemales who had no opportunity whatever of appearing  before\nthe  Revenue  authorities, the presumption  will  be  weaker\nstill and only a few instances would be sufficient to  rebut\nit.\nIf  the Riwaj-i-am produced is a reliable and a\t trustworthy\ndocument, has been carefully prepared, and does not  contain\nwithin its four corners contradictory statements of  custom,\nand in the opinion of the Settlement Officer is not a record\nof the wishes of the persons appearing before him as to what\nthe  custom  should be, it would be a presumptive  piece  of\nevidence in proof of the special custom setup, which if left\nunrebutted   by\t the  daughters\t would\tlead  to  a   result\nfavourable to the collaterals.\tIf, on the other hand, it is\nnot  a\tdocument of the kind indicated above,  then  such  a\nRiwaj-i-am will have no value at all as a presumptive  piece\nof evidence.\nThe  Riwaj-i-ams of the Gurdaspur district prepared  by\t Mr.\nKennaway  in  1913 in so far as they purport to\t record\t the\nlocal  custom as to the right of the daughter to succeed  to\nthe  self-acquired property of her father are  not  reliable\nand trustworthy documents.\nThe answer to question 16 and the answer to question 17\t re-\ncorded therein do not contain the correct record of custom.\nHeld,  that the appellants collateral within fourth  degreea\nSaraswat  Brahmin of Pathankot in the district of  Gurdaspur\nhad  failed to discharge the onus that initially  rested  on\nhim  that the respondent (the daughter) was excluded by\t him\nin  respect of the nonancestral property of her\t father\t and\nthat  therefore\t no  burden  was cast  on  her\tof  adducing\nevidence of particular instances.\nThe general custom laid down in para 23 of Rattigan's Digest\nof   Customary\tLaw  that  \"a  daughter\t is   preferred\t  to\ncollaterals in regard to the self-acquired property of\ttier\nfather\" was approved by the Supreme Court.\nButta  Singh v.

Under s. 2 of Bombay Act VI of 1851\t the\noccupants  were entitled to hold the lands subject  only  to\nthe payment of revenue then payable.  Between 1864 and\t1867\nthe  Government\t of  India acquired these  lands  under\t the\nprovisions of the Land Acquisition Act (VI of 1857).  On 22-\n11-1938\t the Governor-General sold them to  certain  persons\nunder  whom the present respondents claimed.  In April\t1942\nthe appellant acting under the Bombay City Land Revenue\t Act\n(Bombay\t Act II of 1876) issued notices to  the\t respondents\nproposing  to  levy  assessment on the lands  at  the  rates\nmentioned therein.  The respondents thereupon instituted two\nsuits  disputing  the right of the appellant to\t assess\t the\nlands to revenue.  They contended that under the Foras\tLand\nAct  the occupants had acquired the right to hold the  lands\non  payment of revenue not exceeding what was then  payable,\nthat the right to levy even that assessment was extinguished\nwhen  the  Government  acquired the  lands  under  the\tLand\nAcquisition  Act, that the Governor-General having  conveyed\nthe  lands absolutely under the sale deed  dated  22-11-1938\nthe respondents were entitled to hold them revenue-free\t and\nthat  even if revenue was payable it could not\texceed\twhat\nwas payable under the Foras Land Act.\nHeld,  (i)  that under the Foras Land Act (VI of  1851)\t the\noccupants  of Foras lands acquired a specific right to\thold\nthem  on payment of assessment not exceeding what  was\tthen\npayable.\n(ii) that the right of the Government to levy assessment was\nnot  the subject-matter of the land acquisition\t proceedings\nand  that  the\teffect\tof those  proceedings  was  only  to\nextinguish  the rights of the occupants in the lands and  to\nvest them absolutely in the Government.\n(iii)\t  that where there is an absolute sale by the  Crown\nit  does  not necessarily import that the land\tis  conveyed\nrevenuefree.\nThe question is one of construction of the grant.  The\trule\nis  that a grantee from the Crown gets only what is  granted\nby the 168\n1312\ndeed  and nothing passes by implication.  When the grant  is\nembodied in a deed the question ultimately reduces itself to\na  determination of what was granted thereunder.  Section  3\nof  the Crown Grants Act (XV of 1895) that \"all\t provisions,\nrestrictions  conditions  and limitations  over\t shall\ttake\neffect\taccording  to their tenor\" does not apply  when\t the\nquestion is as to the liability to pay revenue.\n(iv)that the Foras tenure became extinguished when the lands\nwere acquired under the Land Acquisition proceedings and  it\nwas  incapable\tof coming back to life when the\t lands\twere\nsold on 22-11-1938 and the respondents cannot claim a  right\nto  pay assessment only at the rate at which it was  payable\nunder the Foras Land Act.\nGoswammi Shri Kamala Vahooji v.

The appellant and his brother Ram Lochan Pandey and one Banslochan were convicted by the Sessions Judge of Ghazipur on 25-2-1954 under Section 302 read with Section 34, I. P. C., for having murdered one Sheomurat and each of them was sentenced to death subject to confirmation by the High Court. There was an appeal to the High Court by all the three accused and there was a reference made by the learned Sessions Judge for confirmation of the death sentence. The High Court gave Banslochan the benefit of doubt and rejected the reference and allowed the appeal so far as it concerned him. The High Court, However, dismissed the appeal so far as it concerned Ram Lochan and the appellant and accepted the reference and confirmed their conviction and the sentence passed on them. The present appeal is by Rishideo alone.\n2 The main point urged by Sri Umrigar who appears in support of this appeal is that  Section 34, I. P. C., has been wrongly applied to the facts of this case. The meaning, scope and effect of Section 34 have been explained on more than one occasion by the Privy Council and by this Court. It will suffice only to refer to the last decision of this Court in the case of -- 'Pandurang v. The State of Hyderabad',  (A) pronounced on 3-12-1954. It is now well settled that the common intention referred to in Section 34 presupposes prior concert, a pre-arranged plan, i.e., a prior meeting of minds. This does not mean that there must be a long interval of time between the formation of the common intention and the doing of the act. It is not necessary to adduce direct evidence of the common intention. Indeed, in many cases it may be impossible to do so. The common intention may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties. Sri Umrigar submits that there is nothing on the record from which a common intention on the part of Rain Lochan and the appellant to murder Sheomurat can be properly inferred.\n3. There is now no dispute as to the following facts, namely,--\n(i) that at dead of night--at 1 A. M. to be precise -- between 4 and 5-6-1953 the two eye-witnesses Baney Pandey (P. W. 1) and Subrati (P. W. 2) on being awakened by the sound of a blow found Ram Lochan and the appellant standing near the cot on which Sheomurat, the victim, had been sleeping;\n(ii) that Ram Lochan was armed with a 'gandasa' and the appellant had a 'lathi' in his hand;\n(iii) that Ram Lochan who was standing near the head of the cot was just lifting up the 'gandasa' after having dealt a blow therewith on the neck of Sheomurat, while the appellant was standing at the foot of the cot armed with his 'lathi';\n(iv) that according to the eye-witnesses and the doctor who carried out the 'post mortem' examination there was only one incised wound on the neck of the victim and there was no sign of any 'lathi' blow on his person;\n(v) that on a hue and cry having been raised Ram Lochan and the appellant ran away together as deposed by Chauthi (P. W. 4), Nageswar (P. W. 5), Soyambar (P. W. 10) and Ram Dhari (P. W. 11);\n(vi) that both Ram Lochan and the appellant absconded and surrendered before the Magistrate after proceedings under Ss. 87 and 88, Cr. P. C. had been taken against them.\nIn his examination under Section 342, Cr. P. C., the appellant denied the prosecution case 'in toto' and maintained that none of the accused persons had gone to the scene of occurrence and did not know anything about the murder of Sheomurat. The Sessions Judge who had the advantage of seeing the demeanour of the prosecution witnesses examined before him, however, believed their evidence and found the above facts to be clearly established beyond any doubt. On these facts the learned Sessions Judge came to the following conclusion:\n \"The question, therefore, arises what offence has been committed by the three accused. Though the actual blow which caused the death of Sheomurat was struck by Ram Lochan yet the only inference that can be drawn from the fact of the three accused going there in the manner is that all the three of them had gone there with premeditated intention to cause the death of Sheomurat and his death was caused in furtherance of that common intention; the very fact that Ram Lochan had been armed with a Gandasa shows that the other two had not only clearly known but had also shared his intention to cause Sheomurat's death and it was immaterial that the actual fatal blow was struck by Ram Lochan while the other two did not actually do anything except keeping guard and giving strengthening support to Ram Lochan. The death of Sheomurat was, therefore, caused ha furtherance of the common intention and all the three accused were responsible therefore under Section 34, I. P. C.\" \nIn the grounds of appeal to the High Court no point was taken in terms that Section 34 had been misapplied in this case. All that was said was that the conviction was against the! weight of evidence on the record and was bad in law. A perusal of the judgment of the High Court clearly indicates that what was urged before it was not that no inference as to the existence of a common intention on the part of Ram Lochan and the appellant to murder Sheomurat could be properly drawn from the above facts if held to be proved but that the evidence by which the above facts were sought to be proved should not have been believed. The High Court had no hesitation in rejecting that contention and finding, in agreement with the trial Court, that both Ram Lochan and the appellant were guilty of murder committed in furtherance of their common intention to kill Sheomurat. It is only in the grounds of appeal to this Court and in the argument before us that the question of the misapplication of Section 34, I.P.C., has been prominently raised. In spite of the able arguments of Sri Umrigar we are not persuaded to take a different view of the facts and circumstances of this case. After all, the existence of a common intention said to have been shared by the accused persons is, on ultimate analysis, a question of fact. We are not of opinion that the inference of fact drawn by the learned Sessions Judge from the facts and circumstances appearing on the record of this case and which was accepted by the High Court was improper or that those facts and circumstances were capable of any innocent explanation.\nIndeed, no other explanation or hypothesis was at all suggested to any witness during their examination at the trial or even in the arguments advanced before us. We are, therefore, unable to hold, on the facts and circumstances of this case, that there was any mis-application of Section 34, I.P.C.\n4. Sri Umrigar, somewhat fervently appealed before us to consider the propriety of inflicting the extreme penalty of law on the appellant. It is true that the appellant did not inflict any blow on the deceased but he shared the common intention to kill him and actually participated in the criminal act by being present on the spot armed with his 'lathi'. In the eye of the law, therefore, he is as much guilty of the whole criminal act as was his brother Ram Lochan who actually dealt the fatal blow on the sleeping man. The sentence must, therefore, be maintained. If there is any extenuating circumstance outside the record calling for the exercise of clemency the appeal must be to authorities other than the Court of law.\n5. For  reasons  stated   above  we  dismiss this appeal.\n"}, {"id": "814017", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "Shyabuddinsab Mohidinsab Akki vs The Gadag-Betgeri Municipal ... on 22 February, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nSHYABUDDINSAB MOHIDINSAB AKKI\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE GADAG-BETGERI MUNICIPAL BOROUGHAND OTHERS.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n22/02/1955\n\nBENCH:\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nBENCH:\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\n\nCITATION:\n 1955 AIR  314\t\t  1955 SCR  (1)1268\n\n\nACT:\nBombay\tMunicipal  Boroughs Act, 1925 (Bombay Act  XVIII  of\n1925),\ts.  19 as amended by Bombay Act\t LIV  of  1954-Legal\neffect\tthereof-Validity of election-S.\t 35(3)(6)-Notice  of\nmeeting-Provisions   of\t  s.  35(3)-Whether   directory\t  or\nmandatory-S.  35(6)-Presence  or absence  of  public-Whether\naffects the validity of meeting.\n\t\t\t    1269\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\nThe first respondent-Municipality-governed by the  Municipal\nBoroughs Act, 1925 (Bombay Act XVIII of 1925) consists of 32\ncouncillors, S, (the appellant) being one of them.  The last\ngeneral\t election to the Municipality took place on the\t 7th\nMay  1951.   The  term of the councillors  was\tthree  years\ncomputed from the first meeting held on 10th July 1951 after\nthe  general  election.\t  In that meeting the  4th  and\t 5th\nrespondents   were  elected  President\tand   Vice-President\nrespectively  for a term of three years.  Act XVIII of\t1925\nwas amended by Bombay Act XXXV of 1954 under which the\tterm\nof office of the councillors was extended from 3 to 4  years\nending on 9th July 1955.  As the term of respondents 4 and 5\nwas  to expire at the end of three years from the 10th\tJuly\n1951 and as the term of the Municipality was extended by one\nyear under the Amending Act XXXV of 1954 a fresh election of\nPresident  and\tVicePresident was necessary to fill  up\t the\nvacancies  thus occurring.  The Collector called  a  special\ngeneral meeting for the 30th July 1954 to elect a  President\nand   Vice-President  for  the\tremaining  period   of\t the\nquadrennium  and nominated the Prant Official (the  District\nDeputy Collector) to preside over that meeting.\t On the 30th\nJuly 1954 the Prant Officer adjourned the meeting to the 3rd\nAugust\t1954 under instructions from the  Collector  without\ntransacting   any   business.\tThe  objection\t raised\t  by\nrespondent  No. 3 against the adjournment was  overruled  by\nthe presiding Officer.\tThe special general meeting was held\non  the\t 3rd  August 1954.  An objection raised\t by  S\t(the\nappellant) that under the provisions of the Act a  President\ncould  not  be\telected\t for a term less  than\ta  year\t was\noverruled by the presiding Officer.  On this 13\t councillors\n(including  S) out of the 32 who were present walked out  on\nthe  ground that the President was to be elected for a\tterm\nless than a year contrary to the provisions of the Act.\t The\nremaining  19 councillors elected the 2nd respondent as\t the\nPresident  for\tthe  remaining period  of  the\tquadrennium.\nImmediately after that another meeting presided over by\t the\nnewly  elected President elected respondent No. 3  as  Vice-\nPresident.   The same point of order raised by S as  in\t the\ncase of the President was overruled, on which 6\t councillors\nwalked\tout  and  the  meeting was  held  by  the  remaining\ncouncillors.   All the 32 councillors were present  both  on\nthe 30th July 1954 and the 3rd August 1954.  An\t application\nunder\tArt.  226  of  the  Constitution  presented   by   S\nquestioning  the validity of the meeting of the 3rd  August,\n1954,  and  consequently  the validity of  the\telection  of\nrespondents Nos. 2 and 3 as President and Vice-President for\nthe remaining period of the quadrennium was dismissed by the\nHigh Court.\nHeld,  (1)  that  the meeting of the  3rd  August  1954,  in\nsubstance though not in form, complied with the requirements\nof the law for holding a valid special meeting and therefore\nthe   meeting  was  not\t invalid  because  the\t record\t  of\nproceedings  would show that whatever had been done  on\t the\n30th  July 1954 and the 3rd August 1954 had been done  under\nthe orders of the Collector.

District Judge of Motihari in favour of Raja Mohan Bikram Shah the proprietor of the Ramnager Raj. After his death the appellants were substituted in his place and stead and they filed an application in the High Court for a certificate for leave to appeal to this Court which was granted.\n2. On 19-3-1910, the Raja executed a registered Sadaua Pataua deed in favour of Messrs. H. Murrey and G. Murrey, hereinafter referred to as the Naraipur Concern, with respect to 17 villages including village Ratni for a period of 31 years. The land in suit appertains to Khata No. 2 of village Ratni, consisting of plot Nos. 2, 87 and 89.\n3 The Raja instituted the suit out of which this appeal arises for a declaration that the land in suit was his Bakasht and the respondents were unlawfully in possession of it. He prayed for recovery Of possession, mesne profits and interest 'pendente lite' as well as future interest.\n4. The respondents resisted the suit on the ground that the land in suit had been permanently settled with them by the Naraipur Concern as 'Raiyats' under a 'Patta Hunda' (Ex. A) described in this case as a 'hukumnama' dated 5-3-1918, that they were settled Raiyats of village Ratni and had been in possession of the land for more than 20 years and that they had acquired occupancy rights in the land in suit. They had also pleaded adverse possession but this plea was abandoned at the trial.\n5. The Additional District Judge of Motihari decreed the suit, leaving the determination of the amount of mesne profits to be decided in a subsequent proceeding. Against this decision the respondents appealed to the High Court which reversed the decision of the trial Court and dismissed the suit.\n6. On the question of possession the trial court disbelieved the respondents' case that they had been in possession for over 20 years but it was of the opinion that near about the time that the 'Sadaua-Pataua' mortgage was about to expire, the respondents were, in fact, in possession. The High Court confirmed these findings.\n7. The trial court was of the opinion that the 'Hukumnama', Ex. A, and the receipts filed by the respondents showing payment of 'hunda' rent were not genuine. It held that the respondents were not inducted upon the land in suit by the Naraipur Concern and they had not acquired any right of occupancy by virtue of the alleged settlement. The High Court was of the opinion that there was no reason to interfere with the findings of the trial Court that the 'Hukumnama' and the receipts were not genuine.\n8. It would appear from the Khatian of village Ratni that the respondents are settled 'Raiyats' of that village. The trial court, however, thought that in order that the respondents may acquire a right of occupancy in the land in suit, it was necessary under Section 21, Bihar Tenancy Act that they must hold the land as 'Raiyats'. The story of the settlement having failed, there was nothing to show that the possession of the respondents of the land in suit was in the capacity of 'Raiyats'. It accordingly held that the respondents had not acquired any right of occupancy.\nThe High Court was of the opinion that the trial Court had erred in holding that there was nothing to show that the possession of the respondents over the disputed land was in the capacity of Raiyats even though the case of settlement had failed. It relied upon an alleged acknowledgment in the written statement (Ex. D) filed by. the Naraipur Concern in a commutation proceeding under Section 40, Bihar Tenancy Act instituted at the instance of the respondents.  It rejected the contention that this document was inadmissible.\nIt was of the opinion that as the application of the respondents for commutation of rent was not resisted on the ground that they were not holding as 'Raiyats', it was clear that their possession as 'Raiyats' was acknowledged by both the Naraipur Concern and the Ramnager Raj. It accordingly came to the conclusion that the respondents had proved their possession over the land in suit as 'Raiyats' and they being settled 'Raiyats' of the village, had acquired the right of occupancy.\n9. It is clear from the findings of the High Court that but for Ex. D, the decision of the trial court would have been affirmed because it agreed with the latter both on the question of possession and the genuineness of the 'Hukumnama' and the receipts. The real question for determination, therefore, is as to whether the statement in Ex. D is an acknowledgment that the respondents held the land in suit as 'Raiyats', whether it was binding on the Ramnager Raj and whether it could create) a 'Raiyati' interest when the creation of such an interest under the 'Hukumnama' has been rejected by the concurrent findings of the courts below.\n10. Two Rent Commutation cases were filed on 7-9-1940, one by the respondent Mangni Mahto and others, and the other by the respondent Chedi Mahto. The former case was numbered 9 of 1940-41 and the latter No. 10 of 1940-41. Exhibit D is the written statement filed by Naraipur Concern in case No. 9. In this document there is no specific statement to the effect that the respondents are holding the land as 'Raiyats'. There is, however, a statement to the effect that Mangni Mahto is in possession from the year 1343 Fasli of two bighas on cash Hunda rent of Rs. 46/8/- annually; Tejman Mahto in possession of 3 bighas on hunda rent at the rate of 18 maunds per bigha annually and Chedi Mahto in possession of 81/4 bighas at the rate of 28 maunds per bigha.\nIt appears from the order sheet Ex. C(3) in case No. 9 that the Ramnager Raj filed an objection on 10-3-1941, which has not been produced in the present suit. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate, who was dealing with the commutation cases directed that Case No. 9 should be put up along with case No. 10 on 3-4-1941, on which date he recorded \"vide order in case No. 10 of 1941.\" The order sheet Ex. C in the latter case reads \"An objection to the commutation petition is filed on behalf of the Naraipur Concern. But it is admitted that the tenant holds the land as 'Batai' and as such the case will proceed.\"\nIt was urged by the respondents that these observations had no reference to the land covered by case No. 9. They referred to land covered by case No. 10 which was not the land in suit. It was only the operative part of the order that the case will proceed which governed case No. 9. If the order in case No. 10 covers case No. 9, it seems that the Naraipur Concern were also contending in the latter case that the applicants were 'bataidars'. The objection filed by the Naraipur Concern in case No. 10 has not been produced in this suit. If it had been, the position might have been more clear. The High Court do not appear to have considered Ex. C all hough they refer to Ex. C(3).\nThe final order in the commutation proceedings as to whether the applications were allowed or rejected has not been filed. Assuming that the Ex. D amounts to an admission by the Naraipur Concern that the respondents were holding the land as 'Raiyats', it is clear from Ex. C(3) that an objection had been filed on behalf of the Ramnager Raj which has not been produced by the respondents. An inference may well be drawn that if they had produced it, it would have shown no such admission on the part of the Ramnager Raj. Both the Naraipur Concern and the Ramnager Raj were parties to the commutation proceedings.\nUnless it was clearly established that the Ramnager Raj made such an admission, it could not be said, as held by the High Court, that there was \"no room for doubt that the possession of the defendants of the land in suit as 'Raiyats' was acknowledged by both the mortgagees and the mortgagor\". It may well have been that the Ramnager Raj was objecting to the maintainability of the applications under Section 40, Bihar Tenancy Act on the ground that the applicants were not occupancy 'Raiyats'.\n11. The conduct of the Ramnager Raj shortly after the expiry of the period covered by the 'Sadaua Pataua' deed establishes that the right of the respondents to possess the land in suit was seriously disputed. Attempts were made by the Ramnager Raj to exercise acts of possession which the respondent resisted. As the dispute was likely to result in a breach of the peace, proceedings under  Section 144, Criminal P. C. were drawn up by a Magistrate.\nIt would appear from the order of the Magistrate Ex. C(l) dated 3-1-1944, that the lawyer for the Ramnager Raj admitted that the lands in village Ratan Purwah were in possession of some persons on Hunda rent, but so far as plot Nos. 2, 87 and 89 in village Ratni were concerned, it was disputed that there had been any settlement of these plots by the Naraipur Concern in the name of Mangni Mahto and Tejman Mahto. It seems improbable, therefore, that the Ramnager Raj would have made any admission of the kind to be found in Ex. D, having resisted throughout the claim of the respondents.\nExhibit D was filed by the Naraipur Concern on 10-3-1941, about ten days before the expiry of the period under the 'Sadaua Pataua' deed. The Naraipur Concern could not have had at that time any serious interest in the land in suit, whereas Ramnager Raj stood to lose Bakasht lands which was a matter of grave concern to a landlord. Any admission made by the Naraipur Concern that the respondents held the land as Raiyats cannot be regarded as an act done in due course of management of the estate having a binding effect on the Ramnager Raj.\nThe Ramnager Raj had filed an objection in Case No. 9 which related to the land in suit and were resisting the right of the respondents to claim commutation of rent independently and there is nothing to indicate that the stand taken up by the Naraipur Concern as stated in Ex. D was accepted. In these circumstances the material contained in Ex. D affords insufficient evidence to lead to the conclusion, that a 'Raiyati' interest had been created in the land in suit.\n12. Although the High Court held on the basis of Ex. D that the respondents were in possession of the land in suit as 'Raiyats', it is to be observed that in their written statement the respondents did not plead that a 'Raiyati' interest had been created in the land because either the Ramnager Raj or the Naraipur Concern or both had acknowledged that the land held by them was as 'Raiyats'. All that was pleaded in para. 9 of the written statement was that the Ramnager Raj and the Naraipur Concern had admitted in the commutation proceedings possession of the respondents as well as the settlement with them. The case of settlement has been rejected by the courts below and a mere admission of possession would not lead to the result that the respondents held the land as 'Raiyats'. The respondents although settled 'Raiyats' of village Ratni did not, therefore, acquire occupancy rights in the land in suit by virtue of the provisions of Section 21, Bihar Tenancy Act.\n13. Since it was the case of the respondents that the settlement of the Raiyati interest with them had been reduced to writing, the 'Hukumnama' required registration. Since it was not registered, it is inadmissible and no evidence could be given as to its terms and the contents of Ex. D could not be used for that purpose, particularly as the 'Hukumnama' and the receipts in support of it have been found not to be genuine. There is nothing on record to show that the alleged admission contained in Ex. D was founded on any settlement other than this 'Hukumnama'.\n14. There was a controversy between the appellants and the respondents as to whether the Naraipur Concern on the terms of the 'Sadaua Pataua' deed had the power to make a settlement of 'Raiyati' interest. It is unnecessary to determine this question as the concurrent finding of fact of the courts below is that the 'Hukumnama' under which the settlement is alleged to, have been made and the receipts in support of it are not genuine, that is to say the case of the respondents that there had been a settlement had not been proved.\n15. In our opinion the High Court erred, in the circumstances of the case, in setting aside the decree of the Additional District Judge of Motihari. The appeal is accordingly allowed with costs throughout. The decree oil the High Court is set aside and that of the! Additional District Judge is restored.\n"}, {"id": "1237708", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "The State Of Bihar vs Kumar Amar Singh And Others(And ... on 10 February, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nTHE STATE OF BIHAR\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nKUMAR AMAR SINGH AND OTHERS(And connected Appeal)\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n10/02/1955\n\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nDAS, SUDHI RANJAN\nBHAGWATI, NATWARLAL H.\nAIYYAR, T.L.

The appellant along with 5 other persons was charged under Section 366, Penal Code, for kidnapping or abducting one Chameli, a minor daughter of a railway employee one Net Ram, in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. The other accused were also charged with having committed offences under various other sections of the Penal Code but which are not necessary to mention for purposes of this appeal. The accused Prahlad Singh and Dhani Ram were acquitted, the accused Baburam was convicted under Section 366 and 368 and the accused Gokaran was convicted under Section 368 Penal Code. The accused Niranjan was also convicted under Section 366 and 368 and the Appellant was convicted under Section 366 Penal Code and was sentenced to 3 years' rigorous imprisonment.\nOn an appeal being taken to the High Court of Judicature  at  Allahabad  (Lucknow  Bench)  the accused Babu Ram and Gokaran were given the benefit of doubt and their convictions and sentences were set aside. The appeals of Niranjan and the Appellant were dismissed and their convictions and sentences were confirmed. The accused Niranjan did not apply for leave to appeal to this Court but the Appellant did and she was granted special leave to appeal by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution on 3-8-1953.\n2. The case of the prosecution was that the appellant was a neighbour of Net Ram at Hardoi Station and was supplying milk to the family. On the evening of 30-4-1949 Chameli went to take milk from her house and she gave her besides milk some sweet saying that it was the Prasad of Katha. Chameli partook of that sweet, prepared tea for her father and her father departed from the house after taking tea to attend his duties at the station at the time of the arrival of the Dehra Dun Express. Some time thereafter, the appellant called Chameli from her house. Chameli went there and the appellant and she together went out for a walk. They were accosted by Shrimati Shanti, Chameli's brother's wife and the appellant replied that they were going to answer a call of nature.\nThe accused Prahlad was following them and all of them went to the rest room of the station where the accused Dhani Ram as also Niranjan and Babu Ram met them. The appellant and Dhani Ram returned from there to their respective houses and Niranjan, Babu Ram and Prahlad took Chameli away, Niranjan and Babu Ram holding her hands and Prahlad following them. The prosecution story further was that Chameli was thus taken by these accused to the village Kanehta where she was mishandled by the accused Babu Ram and Gokaran and was ultimately traced by the police in the house of Niranjan. The police after due investigation challaned the appellant and the other 5 accused to stand their trial for the several offences with which they were charged as above.\n3. The evidence against the appellant consisted of her having given the sweet to Chameli, her having accompanied Chameli for a walk and her having returned back to her house leaving Chameli with the accused Babu Ram, Niranjan and Prahlad. The charge which was framed against her was under Section 366, Penal Code, for kidnapping or abducting Chameli in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. But the trial proceeded only on the footing that she had kindnapped Chameli from lawful guardianship for purpose of illicit intercourse and that charge was held proved against her by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Hardoi. The High Court in appeal also came to the same conclusion and her conviction and the sentence passed upon her by the Sessions Court were therefore confirmed.\n4. This charge required that Chameli should be proved by the prosecution to have been at the date of the offence below 16 years of age. In the then state of the law Section 361, Penal Code, required that she should be under 16 years of age, the offence having been allegedly committed on 30-4-1949. The learned Assistant Sessions Judge came to the conclusion on the evidence of the doctor that Chameli was about 15 years of age and therefore convicted the appellant of the offence under Section 366, Penal Code.\nThe High Court however did not accept that finding and observed: \"I am hesitant in holding that the age of the girl was under 16 though I find affirmatively that she was under 18 years of age\". The High Court evidently did not notice that the amendment of Section 361, Penal Code, which prescribed the outside limit of the age of a minor girl for purposes of that section to be 18 years came into force from 15-7-1949 and the offence in this case was alleged to have been committed on 30-4-1949 on which date the outside limit of age was 16 years. If that was the correct position the appellant could not have been convicted under Section 366, Penal Code.\n5. Realising this position, Shri K.B. Asthana for the respondent tried to argue that even if the appellant could not be convicted under Section 366, Penal Code, by reason of her having kidnapped Chameli from lawful guardianship, she could certainly be convicted under that section for having abducted her for the purpose of illicit intercourse. Apart from the fact that that was not the charge sought to be proved against the appellant, the evidence on the record did not warrant the conclusion that Chameli was either compelled by force or induced by any deceitful means to go from her father's place by the appellant, nor was any, question put to the appellant in her examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C. in regard to her giving of the sweet to Chameli or otherwise compelling or inducing her to leave her father's place. This contention therefore could not avail the Respondent.\n6. We are therefore of the opinion that both the Courts below were in error in convicting the appellant of the offence under Section 366, Penal Code. We accordingly set aside her conviction and the sentence passed upon her and order that she be acquitted and discharged.\n"}, {"id": "43487", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "Gurbakhsh Singh vs State Of Punjab on 16 February, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

Gurbakhsh Singh along with his brother Labh Singh, his son Piara Singh and his brother's son Jawahri was sent up for trial under Section 302 read with Section 34, Penal Code, for having murdered one Mohinder Singh and also under Section 307 read with Section 34, Penal Code, for having  inflicted  gun-shot injuries on one Thakar Singh (P. W. 17).\nThe Additional Sessions Judge acquitted Labh Singh, Piara Singh and Jawahri of both the charges but convicted Gurbakhsh Singh under both Section 302 and Section 307 and sentenced him under the former section to death and under the latter section to 5 years' rigorous imprisonment.\nThe High Court having dismissed his appeal and accepted the reference the present appeal has been brought by special leave of this Court by Gurbakhsh Singh against his conviction and sentences.\n2. The prosecution case is that on 27th or 28th October 1953 there was an altercation between Sundar Singh, brother of Suja Singh and their employee Mohinder Singh on, the one hand and Gurbakhsh Singh and Gurdip Singh on the other over 'changars' raised by Gurbakhsh Singh. who was then in a drunken state, in front of Suja Singh's house. Gurbakhsh Singh is said to have left the place after threatening Sunder Singh and Mohinder Singh with dire consequences.\nThe prosecution story then goes on to say that on 12-11-1953 at about sunset Gurbakhsh Singh armed with a gun and Labh Singh, Piara Singh and Jawahri armed with spears came in front of Suja Singh's house and raised a 'lalkara' and abused Suja Singh and his brother Sunder Singh. Mohinder Singh the employee, came out of Suja Singh's house followed by Suja Singh, Sunder Singh and the- latter's wife Musammat Gurdial Kuer.\nGurbakhsh Singh fired at once and hit Mohinder Singh in the chest and the abdomen. Mohinder Singh fell down and died on the spot. Hearing the report one Thakar Singh, a neighbour, came and implored Gurbakhsh Singh not to fire but Gurbakhsh Singh fired again and injured the right arm of Thakar Singh. Thakar Singh thereupon rushed into the house of Suja Singh and the front door of that house was closed from inside. The first information report was lodged at the police station at 10 p.m. on the same day by Suja Singh.\n3. The incident was witnessed by Suja Singh (P. W. 15), Sunder Singh (P. W. 16), Thakar Singh (P. W. 17) and Joginder Singh (P. W. 18) all of whom were examined before the Additional Sessions Judge. Musammat Gurdial Kuer (P. W. 19) and Jarnail Singh (P. W. 20) who were also said to be eyewitnesses were tendered for cross-examination but were not cross-examined by the defence counsel.\nThe Additional Sessions Judge did not think it likely that Gurbakhsh Singh who alone had a grouse against Sunder Singh and Mohinder Singh on account of the previous altercation would bring along with him his brother Labh Singh who was 70 years of age and his son and nephew who were of the age of 16 years and 14 years respectively to assist him in spite of the fact that he was himself armed with a gun and he accordingly acquitted those three accused.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, believed the evidence of the eyewitnesses so far as such evidence related to Gurbakhsh Singh and on their evidence convicted and sentenced him as mentioned above. On appeal, the High Court agreed with the findings of the Additional Sessions Judge and confirmed the conviction and sentences passed on Gurbakhsh Singh and dismissed his appeal.\n4. Learned Advocate appearing in support of the present appeal has urged that the eyewitnesses who were disbelieved by both the Courts below as regards the other three accused should not have been believed for the purpose of convicting the remaining accused Gurbakhsh Singh.\nAs pointed out by the High Court, the Louse of Labh Singh, Piara Singh and Jawahri is separated from the house of Suja Singh by only forty 'karams'. It is quite likely that after hearing the report of the first shot Labh Singh, Piara Singh and Jawahri had come out of their house and were seen by the eyewitnesses who might well have thought that these three accused persons were the associates of Gurbakhsh Singh and had accompanied him from the beginning. The High Court did not, therefore, consider that these witnesses deliberately and knowingly made any false statement only to implicate those three accused persons.\nLearned counsel also suggested that as all the eye-witnesses were examined under Section 164, Criminal P. C., they must be regarded as unreliable and their evidence should not be acted upon without corroboration by other unimpeachable evidence. It is further submitted that persons who could have deposed in favour of the accused had been arrested and were bound down under Section 107, Criminal P. C. and had been terrorised, Likewise, it is suggested that witnesses examined by the police were not called in Court. The ballistic expert was not called and witnesses who were admittedly present on the spot were not examined in Court.\nMany of these criticisms do not appear to have been advanced before the High Court and further these criticisms only have a bearing on the question of appreciation of evidence and in the present appeal, which is by special leave, this Court cannot, consistently with its practice, convert itself into a third Court of facts. After hearing learned Advocate for the appellant at considerable length we do not think any ground has been made out which will induce us to interfere with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below. The result, therefore, is that this appeal must be dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "1801916", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "State Of Bombay vs Mulji Jetha And Co. on 10 February, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

These two are appeals on leave granted by the High Court of Bombay under Article 133(1) (c) of the Constitution against its common judgment in Second Appeals Nos. 936 and 937 of 1947. The appellant in each of these appeals is the State of Bombay and the respondent is Mulji Jetha & Company.\nThe respondent owned three survey numbers at Jalgaon in the State of Bombay being Survey Nos. 253-A, 254-A, and 253-B, which, prior to the year 1911, were used and assessed as agricultural lands. In the year 1911, the respondent made * an application under Section 35, Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879 (Bombay Act V of 1879) (hereinafter referred to as the Code), to the Collector of Jalgaon for permission to divert the lands comprised in Survey Nos. 253-A and 254-A from agricultural to non-agricultural use for the purpose of constructing thereon a structure in accordance with a plan submitted along with that application. In the year 1912, he made another similar application in respect of Survey No. 253-B.\nThe Collector after referring the plans to the Municipality and obtaining their views, granted the necessary permission, on 1-8-1911, in respect of Survey Nos. 253-A and 254-A, and on 1st August, 1912, in respect of Survey No. 253-B, for diversion of the lands in these three survey numbers to non-agricultural use in accordance with the plans so approved. The assessment of these survey numbers was thereupon revised by enhancing the pre-existing rate from Rs. 1-9-0 to Rs. 20 per acre, under Section 48 of the Code and Rule 56(2) framed by the Government in exercise of the powers under Section 214 of the Code.\nThereupon three 'sanads' (Exs. 38, 39 and 40) were issued on 24-7-1914, by the Collector in favour of the respondent under the said rules in respect of the three survey numbers specifying the enhanced assessment in respect of each of the survey numbers for a period of 50 years commencing from the date of the grant of the permission. Pursuant to the permission granted and in accordance  with he plans approved, the respondent constructed buildings on the said survey numbers and had been paying the revised assessment.\nSurvey Nos. 253-A and 254-A were consolidated into one City Survey No. 2113 and Survey No. 253-B was changed into City Survey No. 2114. In the year 1941, the respondent wanted to build two more bungalows on City Survey No. 2113. He wanted also to dismantle the structures on City Survey No. 2114 and to sell the land comprised therein in convenient plots for building purposes    in   accordance    with    the   Municipal Building   bye-laws.    He    accordingly    wrote two letters to the Collector dated 7-11-1941, one   in respect   of each   of the two  survey numbers, intimating  his intention and added in each of the letters as follows :\n  \"We presume   that   you have   no objection to this.\"\nThe Collector thereupon intimated his reply to both the letters by one letter (Ex.  P-34) dated 11-2-1942, as follows : \"With   reference   to   your   two   applications of 7-11-1941, on the subject noted above, I am to inform you that since the original order  about  the  grant  of  permission  laid down  the  condition  that  bungalows   shall be built in  accordance with the plan produced,   Collector's permission   is necessary to make any alteration or addition in the plan then already approved.\" In view of this reply the respondent filed against the Province of Bombay the two suits out of which the present appeals arise for a declaration of his right and for an injunction, after issuing the requisite notices under Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code.    Appeal No. 9 arises out of the suit relating to Survey No, 2114 and the declaration asked for therein is\n  \n\n\"That the plaintiff is at full liberty and has full right to demolish the buildings, bungalows, out-houses, garage, privies, etc., standing on the property in suit and to divide the land into plots and to sell them for buildings being constructed thereon in accordance with the Municipal Bye-laws, and that neither the defendant nor their officers are entitled to do any act prejudicial to the plaintiff's aforesaid rights.\" Appeal No. 10 arises out of the suit which relates to Survey No. 2113 and the declaration asked for therein is\n \n\n\"That   the plaintiff is entitled to construct buildings on the said land in suit and to make additions and alterations therein in accordance with the municipal bye-laws and that neither the defendant nor any of their officers have any authority in this matter.\"\nThe trial court decided against the plaintiffs contention and dismissed the suits and this dismissal was confirmed on appeals therefrom by the District Judge of East Khandesh at Jalgaon. On Second Appeals, however, the learned Judges of the Bombay High Court reversed the dismissal and granted the declarations asked for by the plaintiff in each of the two suits.\n2. The case of the plaintiff-respondent is that the permission to divert the lands from their original agricultural user to building purposes having been granted in 1911-1912 and the assessment for the entire area comprised in these survey numbers having been enhanced on that basis, the Collector has not right to insist on his permission being obtained for any further alterations or additions to the buildings or for parcelling out the land as building sites and selling them. He also contended that since the lands are situated within the limits of Jalgaon Municipality, he was bound to comply only with the Municipal bye-laws relating to building constructions and that the Collector had no authority in this behalf.\nThe main defence on behalf of the State was set out in paragraph 4 of the written statement and is as follows : \n \"The plaintiff holds the suit land as occupant. Formerly the said land was used and assessed as agricultural land. In 1911 (1912) the Collector granted permission under Sections 65 and 67 to erect buildings thereon in accordance with the plan submitted by the plaintiff. It is denied that the said permission enables the plaintiff to erect buildings on any site whatsoever comprised within the suit land. The plaintiff could lawfully erect buildings only upon the sites that were specified in the said plan, and he could erect them only in accordance with the said plan and he was bound to maintain the rest of the land open. The plaintiff having accepted this condition, it is now one of the terms lawfully annexed to his tenure of the land\".\nBoth the trial Court as well as the first appellate court agreed with this contention of the State and held that though the revised assessment was in respect of the entire area comprised within the respective survey numbers and the permission to divert the land from agricultural to building purposes also related to the entire area, the permission was limited by the condition attached thereto. It was held that the condition was to be gathered from the correspondence, Exs. 41 to 45 between the plaintiff and the Collector. In their opinion this showed clearly that the plaintiff had agreed to build strictly in accordance with the plans and that the permission was granted on that footing.\nDiffering from this view, the learned Judges of the High Court held that the three 'sanads' issued to the plaintiff by the Collector must be taken to be the only contract between the parties and as the repository of the agreement between the Government on the one hand and the registered occupant on the other, that the previous correspondence was not admissible and that since the 'sanads' disclosed no such conditional permission, the Collector had no right to insist on his permission being taken for the alterations contemplated by the plaintiff in respect of the survey numbers which are the subject matter of the two suits.\n3. The correctness of this view has been canvassed before us by the learned Attorney-General and we have heard elaborate arguments as to the scheme of the Code and of the relevant provisions thereof contained in Chapters V and VI. In particular our attention was drawn to Sections 45, 48, 65 to 68, and 73 of the Code. We have been furnished with a copy of Rule 56(2) under which the 'sanads' were issued as also the prescribed form for the 'sanads'. We have also been taken through the contents of the 'sanads' actually issued in these cases as well as through the concurrent findings of the first appellate court and the High Court as regards the substance of the correspondence contained in Exs. 41 to 43.\nA forceful argument has been advanced to us with reference to all the above material, that the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court is erroneous. It is unnecessary, however, to deal with the argument thus advanced since the appeals can be disposed of on a very short ground. For this purpose it is sufficient to notice Ss. 48, 65 and 67 'as they stood prior to 1913' which admittedly applied to the present case in view of the fact that the permission was granted in the years 1911 and 1912.\nThe relevant portions of these three sections as they stood prior to their amendment in 1913 were as follows:\n\"48.   The land revenue liable under the provisions of this Act shall be chargeable--\n(a) upon\" land appropriated for purpose of agriculture;\n(b) upon land appropriated for any purpose from which any other profit or advantage than that ordinarily acquired by agriculture is derived;\n(c) upon land appropriated for building sites.\n65. An occupant of land appropriated for purposes of agriculture is entitled by himself, his servants, tenants, agents or other legal representatives to erect farm buildings, construct wells or tanks or any other improvements thereon for the better cultivation of land or its more convenient occupation for the purposes aforesaid.\nIf any occupant wishes to appropriate his holding or any part thereof to any other purpose, the Collector's permission shall in the first place be applied for by the registered occupant.\nThe Collector, on receipt of such application,\n \n\nX XXX\n \n\n(b) may, after due inquiry, either grant or refuse the permission applied for.\nWhen any such land is thus appropriated to any purpose unconnected with agriculture, it shall be lawful for the Collector subject to the general orders of Government to require the payment of a fine in addition to any new assessment which may be leviable under the provisions of Section 48.\n67. Nothing in the last two preceding sections shall prevent the granting of the permission aforesaid in special cases on such terms or conditions as may be agreed on between Government and the registered occupant.\"\nNow, there is no dispute that the permission that was granted by the Collector in the years 1911 and 1912 for diversion of the suit lands from agricultural use to non-agricultural use for building purposes related to the entirety of the area comprised within the suit survey numbers. All that is claimed on behalf! of the State is that the permission was limited by the condition that the buildings to be erected were to be in accordance with the plans then approved and that any alteration thereof requires the further permission of the Collector or a mutual agreement in respect thereof. Admittedly the basis for this contention is Section 37 of the Code. As it then stood, this section provided that nothing in Section 65 was to prevent the granting of permission in special cases on such terms or conditions as may be agreed upon between the Government and the registered occupant. It is clear from this that the grant of permission under Section 35 may be subjected to conditions. But the imposing of such conditions is to be (1) in special cases, and (2) in such cases it is to be the result of an agreement between the Government and the registered occupant. What has been pleaded in these cases in paragraph 4 of the written-statement, as set out above, is an agreement 'between the Collector' and the registered occupant and what the correspondence, Exs. 41 to 43, discloses is only an agreement, if any, 'between the Collector' and the registered occupant. There is no pleading or proof that there was any agreement between the registered occupant and 'the Government'. Nor is there any indication that applications of the kind in this area had to be treated as special cases.\nObviously \"the Collector\" is not the same as \"the Government\" nor have we been shown any rule framed by the Government which empowers the Collector to act on behalf of the Government with reference to Section 37. That the Collector is different from the Government under the Code is clear from section 8 of the Code which shows that \"the Government\" shall appoint in each district an officer who shall be \"the Collector\" and who may exercise, throughout his district, all the powers and discharge all the duties imposed on a Collector by this Act. The learned Attorney-General could not contest this position. It is clear, therefore, that the State has not made out that there is any valid and legal condition attached to the permission granted by the Collector for the diversion of these lands from agricultural to building purposes. In this view of the matter there is no reason to reverse the declarations granted in favour of the plaintiff-respondent by the High Court.\nIt appears likely that in this litigation the content of Section 37 as it stood prior to 1913 was not noticed and that the defence on behalf of the State and the proof in pursuance thereof was based on Section 37 as it now stands which is as follows:\n \"Nothing in the last two preceding sections shall prevent the granting of the permission aforesaid on such terms or conditions as may be prescribed by the Collector, subject to any rules made in this behalf by the Government.\"\nThe plea taken in paragraph 4 of the written statement does no doubt indicate that it was realised that the condition was to be a matter of 'agreement' but it does not seem to have been appreciated that the agreement was to be between 'the Government' and the registered occupant and 'not' between 'the Collector' and the registered occupant.\n4. In the result both the appeals must be dismissed  with   costs.   But,   in   the   circumstances, there will be only one hearing fee for both the appeals together.\n"}, {"id": "438238", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "Ram Narain vs State Of Punjab on 11 February, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

The Appellant in this appeal by special leave was a Head Constable of Police who was posted as an accountant in the National Volunteer Corps office in Ferozpore District. On 7-2-1950 he withdrew from the Treasury a sum of Rs. 11,579-8-0 on the strength of a contingent voucher being a subsistence allowance bill for the month of February, 1950, purporting to be signed by Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh, Senior Superintendent of Police, Ferozepore. These signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh were alleged to be forged and the Appellant was charged that he on or about 7-2-1950 fraudulently and dishonestly used as genuine a forged document, viz., subsistence allowance bill for the month of February, 1950 which he knew or had reasons to believe at the time he used it to be a forged document and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 467 read with 471, Penal Code.\n2. The Additional District Magistrate, Ferozepore, who tried the case negatived the contention of the Appellant that sanction of the State Government was necessary for his prosecution under Section 5(2), East Punjab National Volunteer Corps Act, 1947. The Magistrate found on the evidence that the signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh appearing on the bill were forged and that the Appellant was guilty of the offence with which he was charged, He therefore convicted the appellant of the offence and sentenced him to 41/2 years' rigorous imprisonment. An appeal was filed by the Appellant to the Punjab High Court against his conviction and sentence. Mr. Justice Soni who heard the appeal also negatived the contention in regard to the sanction and confirmed this conviction. In regard to the sentence however the learned Judge considered the sentence of 41/2 years' rigorous imprisonment imposed upon the appellant as inadequate and thought that a sentence of fine should also have been imposed upon the Appellant. He therefore gave a verbal notice to the counsel for the Appellant to show cause why a sentence of fine should not also have been imposed upon the Appellant and after hearing the counsel for the Appellant the next day imposed upon him in addition a fine of Rs. 11,579-8-0 or in default of payment of fine further rigorous imprisonment of a year and a half. This appeal by special leave is directed against that judgment and order of the Punjab High Court.\n3. The contention in regard to the sanction of the State Government under Section 5(2), East Punjab National Volunteer Corps Act, 1947 was again raised before us by the learned counsel for the Appellant. On a perusal of the rules framed by the State Government under Section 8 of the Act however the learned counsel did not press this contention and nothing more need be said in regard to the same. We are of the opinion that the finding in that behalf arrived at by the learned Additional District Magistrate who tried the case was correct and the Appellant was lawfully   prosecuted   for   the   offence   with which he had been charged.\n4. The charge against the Appellant involved the proof by the prosecution that the signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh on the bill dated 7-2-1950 were forged and that the appellant fraudulently and dishonestly used as genuine the bill bearing these forged signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh for obtaining from the Treasury the sum of Rs. 11,579-8-0. The prosecution established the first point, viz., that the signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh on the bill were forged. Considerable evidence was led by the prosecution including that of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh himself to show that the signatures appearing on the bill dated 7-2-1950 were forged.\nThe Appellant in his defence examined several witnesses connected with the Imperial Bank of India, Ferozepore where the payment had been made to him on the strength of the said bill. He also examined Mr. Charles E. Hardless, a handwriting expert who deposed that the signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh appearing on the bill had been retouched. He however opined that the retouching was made not with a view to improve the signatures but with a view to subsequently distort the same so as to make them differ in appearance from the signatures usually written by Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh. Both the Courts below negatived the defence version and came to the conclusion that the signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh on the bill dated 7-2-1950 were forged. These are concurrent findings of fact and following the well-established practice of this Court we are not prepared to interfere with the same. It can therefore be taken as satisfactorily proved that the signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh on the bill were forged.\n5. The only other contention which the learned counsel for the Appellant urged before us was that there was no fraudulent and dishonest intention on the part of the Appellant in using this forged bill as genuine. He urged that no questions were put to the appellant by the learned Judge when he examined him further in the High Court which gave him an opportunity of explaining the circumstances which were sought to be used against him. It was apparent on the record that the appellant withdrew Rs. 11,579-8-0 on 7-2-1950, Rs. 1,689-2-0 on 8-2-1950 and Rs. 17,889-12-0 on 18-2-1950, thus making up an aggregate sum of Rs. 31,158-6-0 withdrawn by him as subsistence allowance for the month of February 1950. When the Appellant however came to make his expenditure return for the month of February 1950 on or about 3-3-1950 he included therein only the last two sums aggregating to Rupees 19,578-14-0 but not the first sum of Rupees 11,579-8-0 which he had withdrawn from the) Treasury on 7-2-1950. That by itself was enough to show without anything more that the appellant was actuated by a fraudulent and dishonest motive in withdrawing this sum on the forged signatures of Rao Sahib Chowdhury Bhim Singh on that bill.\nOn these circumstances being proved against the appellant it was the duty of the appellant to establish that the non-inclusion of the sum of Rs. 11,579-8-0 in the expenditure return was not dishonest. The only explanation which he vouchsafed in answer to the questions which were put to him by the learned Judge in his further examination was that, he did not include this sum of Rupees 11,579-8-0 in the expenditure return because he did not get B. M. 28 by that time. B. M. 28 was an extract of the bill which he sent along with the bill. It was to have come back to him from the Treasury and would be ordinarily returned at the end of the month. The expenditure return was made by the 3rd of the following month and the Appellant stated that any omission therefrom would be entered in the next month's expenditure return.\nThis explanation however did not go so far as to establish that B. M. 28 in connection with the bill in question was not returned by the Treasury to the Appellant at the end of February 1950. If at all that was his case he ought to have put it in cross-examination to the prosecution witnesses or led evidence himself in that behalf. P.W. 2, a clerk in the Accountant-General's Office, Simla produced the bills but he was not asked anything about B. M. 28 in regard to the bill which was sent on 7-2-1950 and which was supposed to have come back to the appellant from the Treasury after the bill was paid. D. W. 4, S. Harbans Singh was the clerk of the Treasury Office, Ferozepore who deposed to the receipt of the bill dated 7-2-1950. He also was not asked anything about B. M. 28 in connection with that bill. In our opinion the calling of D. W. 4 as his witness afforded the appellant an opportunity of eliciting from him the fact if any, that B. M. 28 in connection with this bill dated 7-2-1950 was not returned by the Treasury to the appellant till after he had filed the expenditure return for February 1950. The Appellant did not elicit this fact at all and on the record as it stands we are unable to find any explanation rendered by the Appellant in regard to the circumstance of his not having included Rs. 11,579-8-0 in the expenditure return which he submitted on or about 3-3-1950.\n6. Under the above circumstances the fraudulent and dishonest motive which actuated the appellant in using the forged bill dated 7-2-1950 as genuine when he withdrew Rupees 11,579-8-0 on 7-2-1950 on the strength thereof was established and the offence with which the appellant had been charged was satisfactorily proved by the prosecution.\n7. He was therefore rightly convicted by both the Courts below of the offence with which he had been charged.\n8. The sentence of 41/2 years' rigorous imprisonment which was imposed upon the appellant was a deterrent sentence deliberately so imposed upon him by the learned Additional District Magistrate, Ferozepore. This was no doubt confirmed by the High Court. But in our opinion there was no justification whatever for imposing an additional sentence of a fine of Rs. 11,579-8-0 or in default further rigorous imprisonment for a period of a year and a half. It is significant to observe in this connection that the embezzlement charge which was leveled against the appellant in regard to this sum of Rs. 11,579-8-0 ultimately failed and we feel that under the circumstances of the case the High Court should not have imposed this additional fine on the appellant.\n9. While maintaining the conviction of the appellant for the charge under Section 467 read with Section 471 of the Penal Code and the sentence of 41/2 years' rigorous imprisonment imposed upon him by both the Courts below we set aside the sentence of fine imposed upon him by the High Court and the sentence of rigorous imprisonment in default of payment thereof.\n10. The appeal will accordingly  be   dismissed   except  for   the   modification   in   the sentence indicated above. \n"}, {"id": "1959233", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "Amrik Singh vs The State Of Pepsu on 28 February, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nAMRIK SINGH\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE STATE OF PEPSU.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n28/02/1955\n\nBENCH:\nAIYYAR, T.L.

Under s. 2 of Bombay Act VI of 1851\t the\noccupants  were entitled to hold the lands subject  only  to\nthe payment of revenue then payable.  Between 1864 and\t1867\nthe  Government\t of  India acquired these  lands  under\t the\nprovisions of the Land Acquisition Act (VI of 1857).  On 22-\n11-1938\t the Governor-General sold them to  certain  persons\nunder  whom the present respondents claimed.  In April\t1942\nthe appellant acting under the Bombay City Land Revenue\t Act\n(Bombay\t Act II of 1876) issued notices to  the\t respondents\nproposing  to  levy  assessment on the lands  at  the  rates\nmentioned therein.  The respondents thereupon instituted two\nsuits  disputing  the right of the appellant to\t assess\t the\nlands to revenue.  They contended that under the Foras\tLand\nAct  the occupants had acquired the right to hold the  lands\non  payment of revenue not exceeding what was then  payable,\nthat the right to levy even that assessment was extinguished\nwhen  the  Government  acquired the  lands  under  the\tLand\nAcquisition  Act, that the Governor-General having  conveyed\nthe  lands absolutely under the sale deed  dated  22-11-1938\nthe respondents were entitled to hold them revenue-free\t and\nthat  even if revenue was payable it could not\texceed\twhat\nwas payable under the Foras Land Act.\nHeld,  (i)  that under the Foras Land Act (VI of  1851)\t the\noccupants  of Foras lands acquired a specific right to\thold\nthem  on payment of assessment not exceeding what  was\tthen\npayable.\n(ii) that the right of the Government to levy assessment was\nnot  the subject-matter of the land acquisition\t proceedings\nand  that  the\teffect\tof those  proceedings  was  only  to\nextinguish  the rights of the occupants in the lands and  to\nvest them absolutely in the Government.\n(iii)\t  that where there is an absolute sale by the  Crown\nit  does  not necessarily import that the land\tis  conveyed\nrevenuefree.\nThe question is one of construction of the grant.  The\trule\nis  that a grantee from the Crown gets only what is  granted\nby the 168\n1312\ndeed  and nothing passes by implication.  When the grant  is\nembodied in a deed the question ultimately reduces itself to\na  determination of what was granted thereunder.  Section  3\nof  the Crown Grants Act (XV of 1895) that \"all\t provisions,\nrestrictions  conditions  and limitations  over\t shall\ttake\neffect\taccording  to their tenor\" does not apply  when\t the\nquestion is as to the liability to pay revenue.\n(iv)that the Foras tenure became extinguished when the lands\nwere acquired under the Land Acquisition proceedings and  it\nwas  incapable\tof coming back to life when the\t lands\twere\nsold on 22-11-1938 and the respondents cannot claim a  right\nto  pay assessment only at the rate at which it was  payable\nunder the Foras Land Act.\nGoswammi Shri Kamala Vahooji v.

The appellant and his brother Ram Lochan Pandey and one Banslochan were convicted by the Sessions Judge of Ghazipur on 25-2-1954 under Section 302 read with Section 34, I. P. C., for having murdered one Sheomurat and each of them was sentenced to death subject to confirmation by the High Court. There was an appeal to the High Court by all the three accused and there was a reference made by the learned Sessions Judge for confirmation of the death sentence. The High Court gave Banslochan the benefit of doubt and rejected the reference and allowed the appeal so far as it concerned him. The High Court, However, dismissed the appeal so far as it concerned Ram Lochan and the appellant and accepted the reference and confirmed their conviction and the sentence passed on them. The present appeal is by Rishideo alone.\n2 The main point urged by Sri Umrigar who appears in support of this appeal is that  Section 34, I. P. C., has been wrongly applied to the facts of this case. The meaning, scope and effect of Section 34 have been explained on more than one occasion by the Privy Council and by this Court. It will suffice only to refer to the last decision of this Court in the case of -- 'Pandurang v. The State of Hyderabad',  (A) pronounced on 3-12-1954. It is now well settled that the common intention referred to in Section 34 presupposes prior concert, a pre-arranged plan, i.e., a prior meeting of minds. This does not mean that there must be a long interval of time between the formation of the common intention and the doing of the act. It is not necessary to adduce direct evidence of the common intention. Indeed, in many cases it may be impossible to do so. The common intention may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties. Sri Umrigar submits that there is nothing on the record from which a common intention on the part of Rain Lochan and the appellant to murder Sheomurat can be properly inferred.\n3. There is now no dispute as to the following facts, namely,--\n(i) that at dead of night--at 1 A. M. to be precise -- between 4 and 5-6-1953 the two eye-witnesses Baney Pandey (P. W. 1) and Subrati (P. W. 2) on being awakened by the sound of a blow found Ram Lochan and the appellant standing near the cot on which Sheomurat, the victim, had been sleeping;\n(ii) that Ram Lochan was armed with a 'gandasa' and the appellant had a 'lathi' in his hand;\n(iii) that Ram Lochan who was standing near the head of the cot was just lifting up the 'gandasa' after having dealt a blow therewith on the neck of Sheomurat, while the appellant was standing at the foot of the cot armed with his 'lathi';\n(iv) that according to the eye-witnesses and the doctor who carried out the 'post mortem' examination there was only one incised wound on the neck of the victim and there was no sign of any 'lathi' blow on his person;\n(v) that on a hue and cry having been raised Ram Lochan and the appellant ran away together as deposed by Chauthi (P. W. 4), Nageswar (P. W. 5), Soyambar (P. W. 10) and Ram Dhari (P. W. 11);\n(vi) that both Ram Lochan and the appellant absconded and surrendered before the Magistrate after proceedings under Ss. 87 and 88, Cr. P. C. had been taken against them.\nIn his examination under Section 342, Cr. P. C., the appellant denied the prosecution case 'in toto' and maintained that none of the accused persons had gone to the scene of occurrence and did not know anything about the murder of Sheomurat. The Sessions Judge who had the advantage of seeing the demeanour of the prosecution witnesses examined before him, however, believed their evidence and found the above facts to be clearly established beyond any doubt. On these facts the learned Sessions Judge came to the following conclusion:\n \"The question, therefore, arises what offence has been committed by the three accused. Though the actual blow which caused the death of Sheomurat was struck by Ram Lochan yet the only inference that can be drawn from the fact of the three accused going there in the manner is that all the three of them had gone there with premeditated intention to cause the death of Sheomurat and his death was caused in furtherance of that common intention; the very fact that Ram Lochan had been armed with a Gandasa shows that the other two had not only clearly known but had also shared his intention to cause Sheomurat's death and it was immaterial that the actual fatal blow was struck by Ram Lochan while the other two did not actually do anything except keeping guard and giving strengthening support to Ram Lochan. The death of Sheomurat was, therefore, caused ha furtherance of the common intention and all the three accused were responsible therefore under Section 34, I. P. C.\" \nIn the grounds of appeal to the High Court no point was taken in terms that Section 34 had been misapplied in this case. All that was said was that the conviction was against the! weight of evidence on the record and was bad in law. A perusal of the judgment of the High Court clearly indicates that what was urged before it was not that no inference as to the existence of a common intention on the part of Ram Lochan and the appellant to murder Sheomurat could be properly drawn from the above facts if held to be proved but that the evidence by which the above facts were sought to be proved should not have been believed. The High Court had no hesitation in rejecting that contention and finding, in agreement with the trial Court, that both Ram Lochan and the appellant were guilty of murder committed in furtherance of their common intention to kill Sheomurat. It is only in the grounds of appeal to this Court and in the argument before us that the question of the misapplication of Section 34, I.P.C., has been prominently raised. In spite of the able arguments of Sri Umrigar we are not persuaded to take a different view of the facts and circumstances of this case. After all, the existence of a common intention said to have been shared by the accused persons is, on ultimate analysis, a question of fact. We are not of opinion that the inference of fact drawn by the learned Sessions Judge from the facts and circumstances appearing on the record of this case and which was accepted by the High Court was improper or that those facts and circumstances were capable of any innocent explanation.\nIndeed, no other explanation or hypothesis was at all suggested to any witness during their examination at the trial or even in the arguments advanced before us. We are, therefore, unable to hold, on the facts and circumstances of this case, that there was any mis-application of Section 34, I.P.C.\n4. Sri Umrigar, somewhat fervently appealed before us to consider the propriety of inflicting the extreme penalty of law on the appellant. It is true that the appellant did not inflict any blow on the deceased but he shared the common intention to kill him and actually participated in the criminal act by being present on the spot armed with his 'lathi'. In the eye of the law, therefore, he is as much guilty of the whole criminal act as was his brother Ram Lochan who actually dealt the fatal blow on the sleeping man. The sentence must, therefore, be maintained. If there is any extenuating circumstance outside the record calling for the exercise of clemency the appeal must be to authorities other than the Court of law.\n5. For  reasons  stated   above  we  dismiss this appeal.\n"}, {"id": "814017", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "Shyabuddinsab Mohidinsab Akki vs The Gadag-Betgeri Municipal ... on 22 February, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nSHYABUDDINSAB MOHIDINSAB AKKI\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE GADAG-BETGERI MUNICIPAL BOROUGHAND OTHERS.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n22/02/1955\n\nBENCH:\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nBENCH:\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\n\nCITATION:\n 1955 AIR  314\t\t  1955 SCR  (1)1268\n\n\nACT:\nBombay\tMunicipal  Boroughs Act, 1925 (Bombay Act  XVIII  of\n1925),\ts.  19 as amended by Bombay Act\t LIV  of  1954-Legal\neffect\tthereof-Validity of election-S.\t 35(3)(6)-Notice  of\nmeeting-Provisions   of\t  s.  35(3)-Whether   directory\t  or\nmandatory-S.  35(6)-Presence  or absence  of  public-Whether\naffects the validity of meeting.\n\t\t\t    1269\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\nThe first respondent-Municipality-governed by the  Municipal\nBoroughs Act, 1925 (Bombay Act XVIII of 1925) consists of 32\ncouncillors, S, (the appellant) being one of them.  The last\ngeneral\t election to the Municipality took place on the\t 7th\nMay  1951.   The  term of the councillors  was\tthree  years\ncomputed from the first meeting held on 10th July 1951 after\nthe  general  election.\t  In that meeting the  4th  and\t 5th\nrespondents   were  elected  President\tand   Vice-President\nrespectively  for a term of three years.  Act XVIII of\t1925\nwas amended by Bombay Act XXXV of 1954 under which the\tterm\nof office of the councillors was extended from 3 to 4  years\nending on 9th July 1955.  As the term of respondents 4 and 5\nwas  to expire at the end of three years from the 10th\tJuly\n1951 and as the term of the Municipality was extended by one\nyear under the Amending Act XXXV of 1954 a fresh election of\nPresident  and\tVicePresident was necessary to fill  up\t the\nvacancies  thus occurring.  The Collector called  a  special\ngeneral meeting for the 30th July 1954 to elect a  President\nand   Vice-President  for  the\tremaining  period   of\t the\nquadrennium  and nominated the Prant Official (the  District\nDeputy Collector) to preside over that meeting.\t On the 30th\nJuly 1954 the Prant Officer adjourned the meeting to the 3rd\nAugust\t1954 under instructions from the  Collector  without\ntransacting   any   business.\tThe  objection\t raised\t  by\nrespondent  No. 3 against the adjournment was  overruled  by\nthe presiding Officer.\tThe special general meeting was held\non  the\t 3rd  August 1954.  An objection raised\t by  S\t(the\nappellant) that under the provisions of the Act a  President\ncould  not  be\telected\t for a term less  than\ta  year\t was\noverruled by the presiding Officer.  On this 13\t councillors\n(including  S) out of the 32 who were present walked out  on\nthe  ground that the President was to be elected for a\tterm\nless than a year contrary to the provisions of the Act.\t The\nremaining  19 councillors elected the 2nd respondent as\t the\nPresident  for\tthe  remaining period  of  the\tquadrennium.\nImmediately after that another meeting presided over by\t the\nnewly  elected President elected respondent No. 3  as  Vice-\nPresident.   The same point of order raised by S as  in\t the\ncase of the President was overruled, on which 6\t councillors\nwalked\tout  and  the  meeting was  held  by  the  remaining\ncouncillors.   All the 32 councillors were present  both  on\nthe 30th July 1954 and the 3rd August 1954.  An\t application\nunder\tArt.  226  of  the  Constitution  presented   by   S\nquestioning  the validity of the meeting of the 3rd  August,\n1954,  and  consequently  the validity of  the\telection  of\nrespondents Nos. 2 and 3 as President and Vice-President for\nthe remaining period of the quadrennium was dismissed by the\nHigh Court.\nHeld,  (1)  that  the meeting of the  3rd  August  1954,  in\nsubstance though not in form, complied with the requirements\nof the law for holding a valid special meeting and therefore\nthe   meeting  was  not\t invalid  because  the\t record\t  of\nproceedings  would show that whatever had been done  on\t the\n30th  July 1954 and the 3rd August 1954 had been done  under\nthe orders of the Collector.

District Judge of Motihari in favour of Raja Mohan Bikram Shah the proprietor of the Ramnager Raj. After his death the appellants were substituted in his place and stead and they filed an application in the High Court for a certificate for leave to appeal to this Court which was granted.\n2. On 19-3-1910, the Raja executed a registered Sadaua Pataua deed in favour of Messrs. H. Murrey and G. Murrey, hereinafter referred to as the Naraipur Concern, with respect to 17 villages including village Ratni for a period of 31 years. The land in suit appertains to Khata No. 2 of village Ratni, consisting of plot Nos. 2, 87 and 89.\n3 The Raja instituted the suit out of which this appeal arises for a declaration that the land in suit was his Bakasht and the respondents were unlawfully in possession of it. He prayed for recovery Of possession, mesne profits and interest 'pendente lite' as well as future interest.\n4. The respondents resisted the suit on the ground that the land in suit had been permanently settled with them by the Naraipur Concern as 'Raiyats' under a 'Patta Hunda' (Ex. A) described in this case as a 'hukumnama' dated 5-3-1918, that they were settled Raiyats of village Ratni and had been in possession of the land for more than 20 years and that they had acquired occupancy rights in the land in suit. They had also pleaded adverse possession but this plea was abandoned at the trial.\n5. The Additional District Judge of Motihari decreed the suit, leaving the determination of the amount of mesne profits to be decided in a subsequent proceeding. Against this decision the respondents appealed to the High Court which reversed the decision of the trial Court and dismissed the suit.\n6. On the question of possession the trial court disbelieved the respondents' case that they had been in possession for over 20 years but it was of the opinion that near about the time that the 'Sadaua-Pataua' mortgage was about to expire, the respondents were, in fact, in possession. The High Court confirmed these findings.\n7. The trial court was of the opinion that the 'Hukumnama', Ex. A, and the receipts filed by the respondents showing payment of 'hunda' rent were not genuine. It held that the respondents were not inducted upon the land in suit by the Naraipur Concern and they had not acquired any right of occupancy by virtue of the alleged settlement. The High Court was of the opinion that there was no reason to interfere with the findings of the trial Court that the 'Hukumnama' and the receipts were not genuine.\n8. It would appear from the Khatian of village Ratni that the respondents are settled 'Raiyats' of that village. The trial court, however, thought that in order that the respondents may acquire a right of occupancy in the land in suit, it was necessary under Section 21, Bihar Tenancy Act that they must hold the land as 'Raiyats'. The story of the settlement having failed, there was nothing to show that the possession of the respondents of the land in suit was in the capacity of 'Raiyats'. It accordingly held that the respondents had not acquired any right of occupancy.\nThe High Court was of the opinion that the trial Court had erred in holding that there was nothing to show that the possession of the respondents over the disputed land was in the capacity of Raiyats even though the case of settlement had failed. It relied upon an alleged acknowledgment in the written statement (Ex. D) filed by. the Naraipur Concern in a commutation proceeding under Section 40, Bihar Tenancy Act instituted at the instance of the respondents.  It rejected the contention that this document was inadmissible.\nIt was of the opinion that as the application of the respondents for commutation of rent was not resisted on the ground that they were not holding as 'Raiyats', it was clear that their possession as 'Raiyats' was acknowledged by both the Naraipur Concern and the Ramnager Raj. It accordingly came to the conclusion that the respondents had proved their possession over the land in suit as 'Raiyats' and they being settled 'Raiyats' of the village, had acquired the right of occupancy.\n9. It is clear from the findings of the High Court that but for Ex. D, the decision of the trial court would have been affirmed because it agreed with the latter both on the question of possession and the genuineness of the 'Hukumnama' and the receipts. The real question for determination, therefore, is as to whether the statement in Ex. D is an acknowledgment that the respondents held the land in suit as 'Raiyats', whether it was binding on the Ramnager Raj and whether it could create) a 'Raiyati' interest when the creation of such an interest under the 'Hukumnama' has been rejected by the concurrent findings of the courts below.\n10. Two Rent Commutation cases were filed on 7-9-1940, one by the respondent Mangni Mahto and others, and the other by the respondent Chedi Mahto. The former case was numbered 9 of 1940-41 and the latter No. 10 of 1940-41. Exhibit D is the written statement filed by Naraipur Concern in case No. 9. In this document there is no specific statement to the effect that the respondents are holding the land as 'Raiyats'. There is, however, a statement to the effect that Mangni Mahto is in possession from the year 1343 Fasli of two bighas on cash Hunda rent of Rs. 46/8/- annually; Tejman Mahto in possession of 3 bighas on hunda rent at the rate of 18 maunds per bigha annually and Chedi Mahto in possession of 81/4 bighas at the rate of 28 maunds per bigha.\nIt appears from the order sheet Ex. C(3) in case No. 9 that the Ramnager Raj filed an objection on 10-3-1941, which has not been produced in the present suit. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate, who was dealing with the commutation cases directed that Case No. 9 should be put up along with case No. 10 on 3-4-1941, on which date he recorded \"vide order in case No. 10 of 1941.\" The order sheet Ex. C in the latter case reads \"An objection to the commutation petition is filed on behalf of the Naraipur Concern. But it is admitted that the tenant holds the land as 'Batai' and as such the case will proceed.\"\nIt was urged by the respondents that these observations had no reference to the land covered by case No. 9. They referred to land covered by case No. 10 which was not the land in suit. It was only the operative part of the order that the case will proceed which governed case No. 9. If the order in case No. 10 covers case No. 9, it seems that the Naraipur Concern were also contending in the latter case that the applicants were 'bataidars'. The objection filed by the Naraipur Concern in case No. 10 has not been produced in this suit. If it had been, the position might have been more clear. The High Court do not appear to have considered Ex. C all hough they refer to Ex. C(3).\nThe final order in the commutation proceedings as to whether the applications were allowed or rejected has not been filed. Assuming that the Ex. D amounts to an admission by the Naraipur Concern that the respondents were holding the land as 'Raiyats', it is clear from Ex. C(3) that an objection had been filed on behalf of the Ramnager Raj which has not been produced by the respondents. An inference may well be drawn that if they had produced it, it would have shown no such admission on the part of the Ramnager Raj. Both the Naraipur Concern and the Ramnager Raj were parties to the commutation proceedings.\nUnless it was clearly established that the Ramnager Raj made such an admission, it could not be said, as held by the High Court, that there was \"no room for doubt that the possession of the defendants of the land in suit as 'Raiyats' was acknowledged by both the mortgagees and the mortgagor\". It may well have been that the Ramnager Raj was objecting to the maintainability of the applications under Section 40, Bihar Tenancy Act on the ground that the applicants were not occupancy 'Raiyats'.\n11. The conduct of the Ramnager Raj shortly after the expiry of the period covered by the 'Sadaua Pataua' deed establishes that the right of the respondents to possess the land in suit was seriously disputed. Attempts were made by the Ramnager Raj to exercise acts of possession which the respondent resisted. As the dispute was likely to result in a breach of the peace, proceedings under  Section 144, Criminal P. C. were drawn up by a Magistrate.\nIt would appear from the order of the Magistrate Ex. C(l) dated 3-1-1944, that the lawyer for the Ramnager Raj admitted that the lands in village Ratan Purwah were in possession of some persons on Hunda rent, but so far as plot Nos. 2, 87 and 89 in village Ratni were concerned, it was disputed that there had been any settlement of these plots by the Naraipur Concern in the name of Mangni Mahto and Tejman Mahto. It seems improbable, therefore, that the Ramnager Raj would have made any admission of the kind to be found in Ex. D, having resisted throughout the claim of the respondents.\nExhibit D was filed by the Naraipur Concern on 10-3-1941, about ten days before the expiry of the period under the 'Sadaua Pataua' deed. The Naraipur Concern could not have had at that time any serious interest in the land in suit, whereas Ramnager Raj stood to lose Bakasht lands which was a matter of grave concern to a landlord. Any admission made by the Naraipur Concern that the respondents held the land as Raiyats cannot be regarded as an act done in due course of management of the estate having a binding effect on the Ramnager Raj.\nThe Ramnager Raj had filed an objection in Case No. 9 which related to the land in suit and were resisting the right of the respondents to claim commutation of rent independently and there is nothing to indicate that the stand taken up by the Naraipur Concern as stated in Ex. D was accepted. In these circumstances the material contained in Ex. D affords insufficient evidence to lead to the conclusion, that a 'Raiyati' interest had been created in the land in suit.\n12. Although the High Court held on the basis of Ex. D that the respondents were in possession of the land in suit as 'Raiyats', it is to be observed that in their written statement the respondents did not plead that a 'Raiyati' interest had been created in the land because either the Ramnager Raj or the Naraipur Concern or both had acknowledged that the land held by them was as 'Raiyats'. All that was pleaded in para. 9 of the written statement was that the Ramnager Raj and the Naraipur Concern had admitted in the commutation proceedings possession of the respondents as well as the settlement with them. The case of settlement has been rejected by the courts below and a mere admission of possession would not lead to the result that the respondents held the land as 'Raiyats'. The respondents although settled 'Raiyats' of village Ratni did not, therefore, acquire occupancy rights in the land in suit by virtue of the provisions of Section 21, Bihar Tenancy Act.\n13. Since it was the case of the respondents that the settlement of the Raiyati interest with them had been reduced to writing, the 'Hukumnama' required registration. Since it was not registered, it is inadmissible and no evidence could be given as to its terms and the contents of Ex. D could not be used for that purpose, particularly as the 'Hukumnama' and the receipts in support of it have been found not to be genuine. There is nothing on record to show that the alleged admission contained in Ex. D was founded on any settlement other than this 'Hukumnama'.\n14. There was a controversy between the appellants and the respondents as to whether the Naraipur Concern on the terms of the 'Sadaua Pataua' deed had the power to make a settlement of 'Raiyati' interest. It is unnecessary to determine this question as the concurrent finding of fact of the courts below is that the 'Hukumnama' under which the settlement is alleged to, have been made and the receipts in support of it are not genuine, that is to say the case of the respondents that there had been a settlement had not been proved.\n15. In our opinion the High Court erred, in the circumstances of the case, in setting aside the decree of the Additional District Judge of Motihari. The appeal is accordingly allowed with costs throughout. The decree oil the High Court is set aside and that of the! Additional District Judge is restored.\n"}, {"id": "1237708", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "The State Of Bihar vs Kumar Amar Singh And Others(And ... on 10 February, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nTHE STATE OF BIHAR\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nKUMAR AMAR SINGH AND OTHERS(And connected Appeal)\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n10/02/1955\n\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nDAS, SUDHI RANJAN\nBHAGWATI, NATWARLAL H.\nAIYYAR, T.L.

The appellant along with 5 other persons was charged under Section 366, Penal Code, for kidnapping or abducting one Chameli, a minor daughter of a railway employee one Net Ram, in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. The other accused were also charged with having committed offences under various other sections of the Penal Code but which are not necessary to mention for purposes of this appeal. The accused Prahlad Singh and Dhani Ram were acquitted, the accused Baburam was convicted under Section 366 and 368 and the accused Gokaran was convicted under Section 368 Penal Code. The accused Niranjan was also convicted under Section 366 and 368 and the Appellant was convicted under Section 366 Penal Code and was sentenced to 3 years' rigorous imprisonment.\nOn an appeal being taken to the High Court of Judicature  at  Allahabad  (Lucknow  Bench)  the accused Babu Ram and Gokaran were given the benefit of doubt and their convictions and sentences were set aside. The appeals of Niranjan and the Appellant were dismissed and their convictions and sentences were confirmed. The accused Niranjan did not apply for leave to appeal to this Court but the Appellant did and she was granted special leave to appeal by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution on 3-8-1953.\n2. The case of the prosecution was that the appellant was a neighbour of Net Ram at Hardoi Station and was supplying milk to the family. On the evening of 30-4-1949 Chameli went to take milk from her house and she gave her besides milk some sweet saying that it was the Prasad of Katha. Chameli partook of that sweet, prepared tea for her father and her father departed from the house after taking tea to attend his duties at the station at the time of the arrival of the Dehra Dun Express. Some time thereafter, the appellant called Chameli from her house. Chameli went there and the appellant and she together went out for a walk. They were accosted by Shrimati Shanti, Chameli's brother's wife and the appellant replied that they were going to answer a call of nature.\nThe accused Prahlad was following them and all of them went to the rest room of the station where the accused Dhani Ram as also Niranjan and Babu Ram met them. The appellant and Dhani Ram returned from there to their respective houses and Niranjan, Babu Ram and Prahlad took Chameli away, Niranjan and Babu Ram holding her hands and Prahlad following them. The prosecution story further was that Chameli was thus taken by these accused to the village Kanehta where she was mishandled by the accused Babu Ram and Gokaran and was ultimately traced by the police in the house of Niranjan. The police after due investigation challaned the appellant and the other 5 accused to stand their trial for the several offences with which they were charged as above.\n3. The evidence against the appellant consisted of her having given the sweet to Chameli, her having accompanied Chameli for a walk and her having returned back to her house leaving Chameli with the accused Babu Ram, Niranjan and Prahlad. The charge which was framed against her was under Section 366, Penal Code, for kidnapping or abducting Chameli in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. But the trial proceeded only on the footing that she had kindnapped Chameli from lawful guardianship for purpose of illicit intercourse and that charge was held proved against her by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Hardoi. The High Court in appeal also came to the same conclusion and her conviction and the sentence passed upon her by the Sessions Court were therefore confirmed.\n4. This charge required that Chameli should be proved by the prosecution to have been at the date of the offence below 16 years of age. In the then state of the law Section 361, Penal Code, required that she should be under 16 years of age, the offence having been allegedly committed on 30-4-1949. The learned Assistant Sessions Judge came to the conclusion on the evidence of the doctor that Chameli was about 15 years of age and therefore convicted the appellant of the offence under Section 366, Penal Code.\nThe High Court however did not accept that finding and observed: \"I am hesitant in holding that the age of the girl was under 16 though I find affirmatively that she was under 18 years of age\". The High Court evidently did not notice that the amendment of Section 361, Penal Code, which prescribed the outside limit of the age of a minor girl for purposes of that section to be 18 years came into force from 15-7-1949 and the offence in this case was alleged to have been committed on 30-4-1949 on which date the outside limit of age was 16 years. If that was the correct position the appellant could not have been convicted under Section 366, Penal Code.\n5. Realising this position, Shri K.B. Asthana for the respondent tried to argue that even if the appellant could not be convicted under Section 366, Penal Code, by reason of her having kidnapped Chameli from lawful guardianship, she could certainly be convicted under that section for having abducted her for the purpose of illicit intercourse. Apart from the fact that that was not the charge sought to be proved against the appellant, the evidence on the record did not warrant the conclusion that Chameli was either compelled by force or induced by any deceitful means to go from her father's place by the appellant, nor was any, question put to the appellant in her examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C. in regard to her giving of the sweet to Chameli or otherwise compelling or inducing her to leave her father's place. This contention therefore could not avail the Respondent.\n6. We are therefore of the opinion that both the Courts below were in error in convicting the appellant of the offence under Section 366, Penal Code. We accordingly set aside her conviction and the sentence passed upon her and order that she be acquitted and discharged.\n"}, {"id": "43487", "date": "2/1955", "tagline": "Gurbakhsh Singh vs State Of Punjab on 16 February, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

Gurbakhsh Singh along with his brother Labh Singh, his son Piara Singh and his brother's son Jawahri was sent up for trial under Section 302 read with Section 34, Penal Code, for having murdered one Mohinder Singh and also under Section 307 read with Section 34, Penal Code, for having  inflicted  gun-shot injuries on one Thakar Singh (P. W. 17).\nThe Additional Sessions Judge acquitted Labh Singh, Piara Singh and Jawahri of both the charges but convicted Gurbakhsh Singh under both Section 302 and Section 307 and sentenced him under the former section to death and under the latter section to 5 years' rigorous imprisonment.\nThe High Court having dismissed his appeal and accepted the reference the present appeal has been brought by special leave of this Court by Gurbakhsh Singh against his conviction and sentences.\n2. The prosecution case is that on 27th or 28th October 1953 there was an altercation between Sundar Singh, brother of Suja Singh and their employee Mohinder Singh on, the one hand and Gurbakhsh Singh and Gurdip Singh on the other over 'changars' raised by Gurbakhsh Singh. who was then in a drunken state, in front of Suja Singh's house. Gurbakhsh Singh is said to have left the place after threatening Sunder Singh and Mohinder Singh with dire consequences.\nThe prosecution story then goes on to say that on 12-11-1953 at about sunset Gurbakhsh Singh armed with a gun and Labh Singh, Piara Singh and Jawahri armed with spears came in front of Suja Singh's house and raised a 'lalkara' and abused Suja Singh and his brother Sunder Singh. Mohinder Singh the employee, came out of Suja Singh's house followed by Suja Singh, Sunder Singh and the- latter's wife Musammat Gurdial Kuer.\nGurbakhsh Singh fired at once and hit Mohinder Singh in the chest and the abdomen. Mohinder Singh fell down and died on the spot. Hearing the report one Thakar Singh, a neighbour, came and implored Gurbakhsh Singh not to fire but Gurbakhsh Singh fired again and injured the right arm of Thakar Singh. Thakar Singh thereupon rushed into the house of Suja Singh and the front door of that house was closed from inside. The first information report was lodged at the police station at 10 p.m. on the same day by Suja Singh.\n3. The incident was witnessed by Suja Singh (P. W. 15), Sunder Singh (P. W. 16), Thakar Singh (P. W. 17) and Joginder Singh (P. W. 18) all of whom were examined before the Additional Sessions Judge. Musammat Gurdial Kuer (P. W. 19) and Jarnail Singh (P. W. 20) who were also said to be eyewitnesses were tendered for cross-examination but were not cross-examined by the defence counsel.\nThe Additional Sessions Judge did not think it likely that Gurbakhsh Singh who alone had a grouse against Sunder Singh and Mohinder Singh on account of the previous altercation would bring along with him his brother Labh Singh who was 70 years of age and his son and nephew who were of the age of 16 years and 14 years respectively to assist him in spite of the fact that he was himself armed with a gun and he accordingly acquitted those three accused.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, believed the evidence of the eyewitnesses so far as such evidence related to Gurbakhsh Singh and on their evidence convicted and sentenced him as mentioned above. On appeal, the High Court agreed with the findings of the Additional Sessions Judge and confirmed the conviction and sentences passed on Gurbakhsh Singh and dismissed his appeal.\n4. Learned Advocate appearing in support of the present appeal has urged that the eyewitnesses who were disbelieved by both the Courts below as regards the other three accused should not have been believed for the purpose of convicting the remaining accused Gurbakhsh Singh.\nAs pointed out by the High Court, the Louse of Labh Singh, Piara Singh and Jawahri is separated from the house of Suja Singh by only forty 'karams'. It is quite likely that after hearing the report of the first shot Labh Singh, Piara Singh and Jawahri had come out of their house and were seen by the eyewitnesses who might well have thought that these three accused persons were the associates of Gurbakhsh Singh and had accompanied him from the beginning. The High Court did not, therefore, consider that these witnesses deliberately and knowingly made any false statement only to implicate those three accused persons.\nLearned counsel also suggested that as all the eye-witnesses were examined under Section 164, Criminal P. C., they must be regarded as unreliable and their evidence should not be acted upon without corroboration by other unimpeachable evidence. It is further submitted that persons who could have deposed in favour of the accused had been arrested and were bound down under Section 107, Criminal P. C. and had been terrorised, Likewise, it is suggested that witnesses examined by the police were not called in Court. The ballistic expert was not called and witnesses who were admittedly present on the spot were not examined in Court.\nMany of these criticisms do not appear to have been advanced before the High Court and further these criticisms only have a bearing on the question of appreciation of evidence and in the present appeal, which is by special leave, this Court cannot, consistently with its practice, convert itself into a third Court of facts. After hearing learned Advocate for the appellant at considerable length we do not think any ground has been made out which will induce us to interfere with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below. The result, therefore, is that this appeal must be dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "1224706", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "Sangram Singh vs Election Tribunal, Kotah,Bhurey ... on 22 March, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nSANGRAM SINGH\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nELECTION TRIBUNAL, KOTAH,BHUREY LAL BAYA.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n22/03/1955\n\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\n\nCITATION:\n 1955 AIR  425\t\t  1955 SCR  (2)\t  1\n\n\nACT:\nRepresentation\tof the People Act (XLIII) of  1951,  section\n105  Effect  of-Finality  and conclusiveness  of  orders  of\nElection\tTribunals\t-Article       136\t  of\nConstitution--Jurisdiction of Supreme Court-Jurisdiction and\npowers\tof High Courts under Article 226 of  the  Constitut-\ntion-Whether   in  any\tway  affected-Writ  of\t Certiorari-\nPrinciples governing grant of-Laws of procedure-Grounded  on\nnatural\t justice-Designed to promote  justice-Representation\nof  the\t People Act of 1951, subsection (2) of\tsection\t 90-\nProcedure  for\ttrial of Election  petitions-Code  of  Civil\nProcedure, 1908, sections 27, 30 and 32-Distinction  between\n'Penalty\"  for\tnon-appearance of parties to suit  and\tcon-\nsequences   flowing  from  non-appearance  in  response\t  to\nsummons-Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Order 5, rules I\t and\n5  and\tOrder  8, rules I and 14, Order\t 9,  rules  6(1)(a)-\n2,7,12\tand 13-Order 15, rule 3Order 17, rules 1(1)  and  2-\nTrial\tof  suits-First\t hearing  and\tadjourned   hearing-\nDistinction-Consequences of non-appearance-Ex parte  hearing\nand  ex\t parte\torder-Principles  governing  discretion\t  of\nCourts-Adjournment of hearing-Convenience of witnesses.\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\nNotwithstanding\t  the  provision  in  section  105  of\t the\nRepresentation\tof the People Act (Act XLIII) of  1951\tthat\nevery order of an Election Tribunal made under the Act shall\nbe  final  and conclusive, the High Court  and\tthe  Supreme\nCourt  have unfettered jurisdiction to examine\twhether\t the\ntribunal, in the exercise of its undoubted jurisdiction, has\nacted  legally\tor otherwise, This  jurisdiction  cannot  be\ntaken  away by a legislative device that purports to  confer\npower  on a tribunal to act illegally.\tThe legality  of  an\nact or conclusion is something that exists outside and apart\nfrom the decision of an inferior tribunal.

The proceedings\nwere  then adjourned for certain hearings at  Udaipur.\t The\nappellant did not appear on the first three hearings at that\nplace  so  the\ttribunal proceeded ex  parte.\tHis  counsel\nappeared  on the fourth hearing but was not allowed to\ttake\nany  further part in the proceedings because no\t good  cause\nwas shown for the earlier non-appearance and so the tribunal\nrefused to set aside its \"ex parte order\".\nHeld,  (1) Under section 90(2) of the Representation of\t the\nPeople Act the procedure for the trial of election petitions\nis  to\tbe, as near as may be, the same as in the  trial  of\nsuits under the Civil Procedure Code;\n(2)  under  the Civil Procedure Code there is no such  thing\nas  an\tex parte order for non-appearance\"  which  precludes\nfurther\t appearance at an adjourned hearing until the  Order\nis  set aside.\tIf a party appears at an  adjourned  hearing\nthe  court  has\t a  discretion\t(which\tmust  be   exercised\njudicially) either to allow him to appear oil such terms  as\nit thinks fit, or to disallow further appearance; but\n(3)  if\t he is allowed to appear then, unless good cause  is\nshown  under Order 9, rule 7 for the earlier  non-appearance\nthe  proceedings must continue from the stage at  which\t the\nlater  appearance  is  entered and the\tparty  so  appearing\ncannot\tbe relegated to the position he would have  occupied\nif he had appeared at the earlier hearing or hearings; also,\n(4)  in\t exercising its discretion the court must  see\tthat\njustice is done to all concerned, including the witnesses\nRule  6\t (1) (a) of Order 9 of the Civil Procedure  Code  is\nconfined  to  the  first hearing of the suit  and  does\t not\napply,\tper  se to subsequent hearings. 0. 9, r. 7  gives  a\nparty a right to be relegated to the position he would\thave\noccupied  if  he  had appeared at  the\tearlier\t hearing  or\nhearings if he shows good cause.  It does not per se prevent\nfurther appearance when no good cause is shown.\t O. 17, r. 2\napplies\t at  the adjourned hearing and there, the  Court  is\ngiven a wide discretion to make such order as it thinks fit.\n3\nA code of procedure is a body of law designed to  facilitate\njustice\t and further its ends, and should not be treated  as\nan  enactment providing for punishments and penalties.\t The\nlaws  of procedure are grounded on the principle of  natural\njustice\t which\trequires that men should  not  be  condemned\nunheard,  that decisions should not be reached behind  their\nbacks, that proceedings that affect their lives and property\nshould\tnot continue in their absence and that\tthey  should\nnot  be\t precluded from participating in them.\t Subject  to\nclearly\t defined exceptions the laws of procedure should  be\nconstrued wherever reasonably possible, in the light of that\nprinciple.   The court is invested with the widest  possible\ndiscretion to see that justice is done to all concerned.  No\nhard  and fast rule can be laid down; and the court  in\t the\nexercise  of its judicial discretion will have, in  a  given\ncase, to determine what consequences are to follow from non-\nappearance.  An order awarding costs, or an adjournment,  or\nthe  consideration of the written statement and the  framing\nof  the issues on the spot, can in some cases meet the\tends\nof  justice.   In other cases, more drastic  action  may  be\ncalled for.\nBy  \"ends  of  justice\" is meant not  only  justice  to\t the\nparties\t but  also  to\twitnesses  and\tothers\twho  may  be\ninconvenienced.\t  The  convenience of the  witnesses,  which\ndeserves  the  greatest consideration,\tis  ordinarily\tlost\nsight  of in this class of case.  Justice strongly.  demands\nthat  this  unfortunate section of the general\tpublic\tcom-\npelled\tto  discharge  public duties, usually  at  loss\t and\ninconvenience  to  themselves should not be ignored  in\t the\nover-all  picture  of  what  will best\tserve  the  ends  of\njustice;  and it may well be a sound exercise of  discretion\nin a particular case to refuse an adjournment and permit the\nplaintiff to examine the witnesses present and not allow the\ndefendant  to  cross-examine them.   But  broadly  speaking,\nafter\tall  the  various  factors  have  been\ttaken\tinto\nconsideration and carefully weighed, the endeavour should be\nto  avoid  snap decisions and to afford the parties  a\treal\nopportunity of fighting out their cases fairly squarely.\nThe  Court must in every case exercise the discretion  given\nto  it.\t  Its hands are not tied by a  so-called  \"ex  parts\norder\", and, if it thinks they are tied by rule 7 of Order 9\nof the Code, then it is not exercising the discretion  which\nthe law says it should, and in a given case interference may\nbe called for.\nHeld,  that  the  Election Tribunal  did  not  exercise\t the\ndiscretion  given to it by law because of a  misapprehension\nthat  it  had  none.  It was directed to do so\tnow  and  to\nproceed\t with the further hearing of the case in  accordance\nwith law.\nHari  Vishnu v. Ahmed Ishaque ([1955] 1 S.C.R. 1104),  Darga\nShankar\t Mehta\tv.

It  is\nassumed\t that the title claimed by the person receiving\t the\nproperty under the arrangement had always resided in him  or\nher  so far as the property falling to his or her  share  is\nconcerned and therefore no conveyance is necessary.\nBut  in\t view of the fact that the Courts lean\tstrongly  in\nfavour of family arrangements that bring about harmony in  a\nfamily\tand do justice to its various members and avoid,  in\nanticipation, future disputes which might ruin them all\t the\nSupreme\t Court,\t carrying the principle further,  upheld  an\narrangement  under  which one set of  members  abandons\t all\nclaim  to  all title and interest in all the  properties  in\ndispute and acknowledges that the sole and absolute title to\nall  the  properties  resides in only one  of  their  number\n(provided  he or she had claimed the whole and made such  an\nassertion of title) and are content to take such  properties\nas  are\t assigned to their shares as gifts pure\t and  simple\nfrom  him or her, or as a conveyance for consideration\twhen\nconsideration is present.\nThe  legal  position  in such a case  would  be\t this.\t The\narrangement or compromise would set out and define that\t the\ntitle claimed by A to all the properties in dispute was\t his\nabsolute  title as claimed and asserted by him and  that  it\nhad always resided in him.  Next, it would effect a transfer\nby A to B, C and D (the other members to the arrangement) of\nproperties X, Y and Z; and thereafter B, C and D would\thold\ntheir respective titles under the title derived from A.\t But\nin  that event, the formalities of law about the passing  of\ntitle\n23\nby transfer would have to be observed, and under the present\nstate of law either registration  or twelve  years'  adverse\npossession would be necessary.\t   But\tin the present\tcase\nthe arrangement was made in 1875 when\tthe   Transfer\t  of\nProperty  Act was not in force and no writing was  required;\nand  as there is no writing, the Registration Act  does\t not\napply either.  Therefore, the oral arrangement of 1875 would\nbe  sufficient\tto pass title in this way and that  is\twhat\nhappened.\nOnce  a reversioner has given his assent to  an\t alienation,\nwhether\t at  the time, or as a part of the  transaction,  or\nlater  as  a distinct and separate act, he is  bound  though\nothers may not be, and having given his assent he cannot  go\nback  on it to the detriment of other persons; all the\tmore\nso when he himself receives a benefit.\nIt is settled law that an alienation by a widow in excess of\nher  powers is not altogether void but only voidable by\t the\nreversioners,  who  may\t either\t singly\t or  as\t a  body  be\nprecluded from exercising their right to avoid it either  by\nexpress\t ratification or by acts which treat it as valid  or\nbinding.\nThe  principle\tapplicable  to the present case\t is  a\trule\nunderlying many branches of the law which precludes a person\nwho, with full knowledge of his rights, has once elected  to\nassent\tto  a transaction voidable at his instance  and\t has\nthus  elected  not to exercise his right to avoid  it,\tfrom\ngoing back on that and avoiding it at a later stage.  Having\nmade his election he is bound by it.\nHeld,  that  in\t the present case the plaintiff\t who  is  in\ntitulo\t now  that  the\t succession  has  opened  out,\t had\nunequivocally\tassented  to  the  arrangement\t with\tfull\nknowledge of the facts and accepted benefit under it, so  he\nis now precluded from avoiding it, and any attempts he\tmade\nto  go behind that assent when it suited his purpose  cannot\nrender\tthe  assent once given nugatory even though  it\t was\ngiven  when he was not in titulo and even though the  assent\nwas to a series of gifts.\nMst.

There  is  no warrant  for  confining  transfers\t \"by\noperation of law\" to the three cases of death, devolution or\nsuccession  or to transfers by operation of  statutory\tlaws\nonly.  If the document in question could be construed to  be\na  transfer of or an agreement to transfer the decree to  be\npassed\tin  future,  then on the  decree  being\t passed,  by\noperation  of  equity,\tthe  respondents  would\t become\t the\ntransferees  of\t the decree by operation of law\t within\t the\nmeaning of Order XXI, rule 16.\nPer  BHAGWATI J.-Section 5 of the Transfer of  Property\t Act\ndefines\t a  \"transfer of property\" as an act  by  which\t the\ntransferor  conveys property in present or in future to\t the\ntransferee  or\ttransferees.  The words \"in  present  or  in\nfuture\"\t qualify  the  word  \"conveys\"\tand  not  the\tword\n\"property\"  in the section.  A transfer of property that  is\nnot  in existence operates as a contract to be performed  in\nthe future which may be specifically enforced as soon as the\nproperty comes into existence.\tIt is only by the  operation\nof  this  equitable principle that as soon as  the  property\ncomes  into  existence and is capable of  being\t identified,\nequity\ttaking as done that which ought to be done,  fastens\nupon  the  property  and the contract to  assign  becomes  a\ncomplete  equitable  assignment.  There is  nothing  in\t the\nprovisions  of the Code of Civil Procedure or any other\t law\nwhich  prevents the operation of this  equitable  principle,\nand  an\t assignment in writing of a decree to be  passed  in\nfuture\twould become a complete equitable assignment on\t the\ndecree being passed and would fall within the \"assignment in\nwriting\" contemplated by Order XXI, rule 16 of the Code.\nA mere transfer of property as such does not by itself spell\nout  a transfer of a decree which has been passed or may  be\npassed\tin respect of that property and it would require  an\nassignment  of\tsuch  decree  in  order\t to  effectuate\t the\ntransfer.   But\t where the property is an  actionable  claim\nwithin\tthe  meaning of the definition in section 3  of\t the\nTransfer  of Property Act and is transferred by means of  an\ninstrument  in\twriting, the transferee could by  virtue  of\nsection\t 130 of the Transfer of Property Act step  into\t the\nshoes  of the transferor and claim to be the  transferee  of\nthe decree and apply for execution of the decree under Order\nXXI, rule 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nPer  IMAM  J.-There must be a decree in existence  which  is\ntransferred  before  the  transferee can  benefit  from\t the\nprovisions\n\t\t\t    1371\nof  rule 16.  The ordinary and natural meaning of the  words\nof  rule  16  can  carry no  other  interpretation  and\t the\nquestion  of  a\t strict and  narrow  interpretation  of\t its\nprovisions does not arise.\nCase-law reviewed.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:\n"}, {"id": "292651", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "U.J.S.

This new right is not expressed to be\t conditioned\nor  controlled by anything that may have happened  prior  to\nthe   revision\t application  under  sub-section   (1)\t for\nenhancement  of sentence.  Therefore, whenever there  is  an\napplication for enhancement of sentence, a notice must issue\nunder  sub-section (2) to the accused person to\t show  cause\nand whenever such notice is issued, the accused person must,\nunder  sub-section (6), be given an opportunity, in  showing\ncause  against enhancement, also to show cause\tagainst\t his\nconviction.\nIt is not correct to say that sections 421, 435 & 439 of the\nCode give the court a discretion not to decide the appeal or\nrevision brought before it.  The discretion conferred on the\nHigh  Court  does not authorise it to say that it  will\t not\nlook at the appeal or revision. The Court's bounden duty  is\nto look into the appeal or revision and decide it,  although\nin  the\t process of arriving at its decision it has  a\tvery\nwide discretion.\nThere  is  no reason for holding that there is a  merger  or\nreplacement  of the Judgment of the trial Court into  or  by\nthe  Judgment  of  the High Court only when  the  appeal  or\nrevision  is  heard on notice to the respondent\t and  either\nallowed wholly or partially or dismissed but not when it  is\nheard  without\tnotice\tto  the\t respondent  and   dismissed\nsummarily;  for this purpose it makes no difference  whether\nthe  dismissal\tis  summary or otherwise,  and\tthere  is  a\njudgment of the High Court in all the three cases.  The only\ndifference  in substance is that in the first two cases\t the\njudgment is final qua both parties while in the third  case,\ni.e., when an appeal or revision by the accused is summarily\ndismissed without issuing notice to the State, the  judgment\nis  final only qua the accused who preferred the  appeal  or\nrevision.   This is based not on any technical\tdoctrine  of\nres  judicata, for there is none in criminal cases,  but  on\nthe general principle of finality of judgment.\tIn the first\ntwo  cases  there  can, after the judgment,  be\t no  further\napplication  by\t the State for enhancement of  sentence\t and\ntherefore  no question of the application of section  439(6)\ncan  arise.   In  the last case, i.e., in  case\t of  summary\ndismissal  the Judgment not being final qua the\t State,\t the\nState  may apply for enhancement of sentence and if it\tdoes\nthe accused becomes entitled again to show cause against his\nconviction  also  by  reason of the  special  provisions  of\nsection 439(6).\nPer BHAGWATI and IMAM JJ.-A Judgment pronounced by the\tHigh\nCourt in the exercise of its appellate or revisional\n96\njurisdiction  after issue of a notice and a full hearing  in\nthe presence of both the parties would certainly be  arrived\nat after due consideration of the evidence and all arguments\nand  would therefore be a final judgment and  such  judgment\nwhen  pronounced  would replace the judgment  of  the  lower\ncourt,\tthus  constituting  the only final  judgment  to  be\nexecuted  in accordance with law by the court  below.\tWhen\nhowever a petition of appeal presented by a convicted person\nfrom jail is summarily dismissed under s. 421 or a  revision\napplication made by him is dismissed summarily or in  limine\nwithout hearing him or his pleader what the High Court\tdoes\nin  such  a case is to refuse to entertain the\tpetition  of\nappeal\tor the revision application and the order passed  by\nthe High Court dismissed  or rejected\" cannot be said to  be\nan  expression of the opinion of the court arrived at  after\ndue consideration of the evidence and all the arguments.\nNo  notice for enhancement of sentence can be issued by\t the\nHigh Court when a judgment is pronounced by it after a\tfull\nhearing\t in  the  presence of both  the\t parties  either  in\nexercise  of its appellate or its  revisional  jurisdiction.\nSuch notice for enhancement of sentence can be issued by  it\neither\tsuo motu or at the instance of an  interested  party\nwhen  the  judgment of the lower court subsists and  is\t not\nreplaced  by its own judgment given in the exercise  of\t its\nappellate or revisional jurisdiction.  When the Judgment  of\nthe lower court has been under its scrutiny on notice  being\nissued to the opposite party and on a full hearing  accorded\nto  both the parties notice for enhancement of sentence\t can\nonly  be  issued  by it before it  pronounces  its  judgment\nreplacing that of the lower court.  When such hearing is  in\nprogress it is incumbent upon the High Court or the opposite\nparty to make up its mind before the judgment is  pronounced\nwhether a notice for enhancement of sentence should issue to\nthe accused.\nCase-law discussed.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:\n"}, {"id": "999102", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "A.V.

He continued to receive his wages at\t the\nspecified rate until October 1949.  In October 1949 he\tmade\nan  application through an official of the Registered  Trade\nUnion-a person permitted by the authority under\t sub-section\n(2) of s. 15 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936-claiming\t his\nwages due in respect of six months from May to October 1949.\nThe respondent did not allege delay in the\n1354\npayment\t  of  his  wages  or  deduction\t of  his  wages\t  in\ncontravention of the provisions of s. 5 or s. 7 of Act IV of\n1936 respectively.  The respondent alleged that he had\tbeen\npaid his actual wages as fixed by the railway administration\nbut  that after the introduction of the scheme of  upgrading\nof persons employed under the daily wages scheme, others who\nwere  junior  to him had been placed on\t the  monthly  wages\nscheme\twhereas his claim to be so placed, had been  ignored\nand that he had not been paid wages on the scale to which he\nwould  have  been  entitled if he had  been  placed  on\t the\nmonthly wages scheme.\nHeld,  per SINHA J. (VIVIAN BosE and VENYATARAMA  AYYAR\t JJ.\nconcurring,   JAGANNADHADAS   J.   dissenting),\t  that\t the\nrespondent's complaint fell under the category of  potential\nwages  and  the\t authority appointed under the\tAct  had  no\njurisdiction to decide the question of potential wages.\t  It\nhad  the jurisdiction to decide what actually the  terms  of\nthe  contract between the parties were, that is to  say,  to\ndetermine the actual wages.\nOn  the case as made on behalf of the respondent, orders  of\nthe  superior officers were necessary to upgrade him from  a\ndaily wageearner to a higher cadre.  The authority under the\nAct  has  not been empowered under s. 15 to  make  any\tsuch\ndirection to the superior officers.\nPer  JAGANNADHADAS  J.-Undoubtedly  a  claim  to  a   higher\npotential  wage cannot be brought in under the\tcategory  of\n\"claim\tarising out of deduction from the wages or delay  in\npayment\t of  the  wages\"  if  that  wage  depended  on\t the\ndetermination by a superior departmental or other  authority\nas  to whether or not a particular employee is\tentitled  to\nthe higher wage-a determination which involves the  exercise\nof  administrative judgment or discretion or  certification,\nand which would, in such a situation, be a condition of\t the\npayability of the wage.\t But where the higher wage does\t not\ndepend\t upon\tsuch  determination  but  depends   on\t the\napplication of and giving effect to certain rules and orders\nwhich,\tfor this purpose, must be deemed to be\tincorporated\nin  the\t contract  of  employment, such\t a  wage  is  not  a\nprospective   wage  merely  because  the  paying   authority\nconcerned makes default or commits error in working out\t the\napplication  of\t the rules.  The wage under the Act  is\t not\nnecessarily  the  immediately  pre-existing  wage  but\t the\npresently  payable  wage.  Whether or not  an  employee\t was\nentitled to wages of a higher category than what he was till\nthen drawing would depend entirely on the scope of the rules\nwith reference to which he is entitled to become one in\t the\nhigher category and it cannot be assumed a priori that\tsuch\na claim is a claim to \"prospective wages\".\nOn the facts of the case as found the dispute as to the wage\nwas one that fell within the jurisdiction of the \"authority\"\nconcerned.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:\n"}, {"id": "549992", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "Shivnandan Sharma vs The Punjab National Bank Ltd on 15 March, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nSHIVNANDAN SHARMA\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK LTD.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n15/03/1955\n\nBENCH:\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nBENCH:\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\n\nCITATION:\n 1955 AIR  404\t\t  1955 SCR  (1)1427\n\n\nACT:\nMaster\t and  servant-Banker-Agreement\tbetween\t  Bank\t and\nTreasurers-Treasurers,\t whether  servants  or\t independent\ncontractors -Cashier appointed by Treasurer-Whether  servant\nof the Bank.\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\nThe  appellant\twas  appointed head cashier in\tone  of\t the\nbranches  of the respondent Bank by the Treasurers who\twere\nin charge of the Cash Department of the Bank by virtue of an\nagreement  between them.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Punjab by leave granted under Article  133 of the Constitution read with Sections 109 and 110 and Order 45, Rule 2 Civil P. C. The appeal arises out of a suit filed in 1938 by the respondent herein, Raja Shiv Rattan Dev Singh, Raja of Poonch against (1) Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Amritsar, (2) Local Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee of Sri Darbar Sahib, Amritsar, and (3) 57 Sikhs, for a declaration to the effect that a house known as Bunga Raja Dhian Singh in Amritsar and four shops appurtenant thereto, two of which are close to the Sikh Gurdwara, Sri Darbar Sahib, belong to him and are his private property and that they are not a Sikh Gurdwara.\nThe suit which was filed in 1938 was dismissed by the trial Court on certain preliminary issues and that dismissal was reversed on first appeal and the suit was remanded. On second appeal therefrom to the High Court the dismissal by the trial court was restored by a Single Judge in 1941. Against this there was a Letters Patent Appeal to a Bench.\nThat appeal was first heard by a Bench which, after hearing the matter and coming to some tentative conclusions, on the points raised before them, made an order dated 16-6-1941, adjourning the hearing of the appeal to a later date for reasons set out therein. For one reason or other this appeal could not be taken up for a considerable time. It ultimately came up for final disposal before a Bench of the High Court in the year 1950.\nThe learned Judges, by their judgment dated 20-6-1950, gave certain findings on the preliminary issues raised and as a result thereof reversed the judgment of the Single Judge of the High Court, allowed the appeal and returned the case back to, the trial Court \"for proceeding in accordance! with law\". It is against this order of the High Court that the present appeal has been brought to this Court.\n2. A preliminary objection has been raised before us at the outset that this appeal is incompetent and that the provisions under which leave was granted by the High Court were inapplicable to the case, inasmuch as the order of the High Court appealed against is not a final order within the meaning of Article  133 of the Constitution.\nIt may also be mentioned that at the conclusion of the hearing, the learned Attorney-General mentioned to us that, since the passing of the order of the High Court in 1950 returning the case for further disposal, the trial Court has disposed of the case, there having been no stay and that the suit has since been decreed in favour of the present respondent and that inasmuch as no appeal has been filed against that decree, this is an additional ground by reason of which the appeal is incompetent.\nA certified copy of the judgment of the trial Court on remand has been since placed before us and we have heard further arguments on this preliminary objection in the light thereof. This will be dealt with at the end of this judgment.\n3. The present litigation arises out of certain events relating to the suit property which arose, out of the provisions of the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, (Punjab Act VIII of 1925) (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The Act came into force on 1-11-1925. Under Section 3(2) of the Act, the Provincial Government issued a notification on 13-12-1927, with reference to a claim made and list forwarded to the Government under Section 3(1) alleging that the suit properties belong to the Sikh Gurdwara, Harmandir Sahib (Darbar Sahib).\nThree persons including the present respondent filed objections thereto under Section 5(1) of the. Act, each claiming the properties as his own. The objections of the other two, viz., Nikka Singh and Suchat Singh were, in course of time, either withdrawn or ultimately dismissed. The objection by the respondent, Raja of Pooneh, came up for consideration before the Sikh Gurdwara Tribunal, constituted under the Act. There was a compromise between the Raja and the Local Committee of the Gurdwara and as a result thereof a decree was passed by the Gurdwara Tribunal on 17-6-1933, in terms of the compromise.\nThe substance of that compromise was that the property (Bunga and the shops) were admitted to be the property of the Raja, but that the Bunga, excluding the shops would be a waqf for the use of the pilgrims to the Darbar Sahib, that the income from the shops would be spent in the interests of the Bunga, that the management of the Bunga would be with the Local Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee subject to the previous eon-sent, in writing, of the Raja and subject also to the general advice and directions of the Raja, that the letting out of the shops and the ejectment of the tenants therein would rest with the Raja and that the income from the shops would be made available for the expenses of the Bunga.\nIt may be mentioned here that a Bunga is \"a hostel where pilgrims, coming from various parts of India, to pay a visit to the Golden Temple, stay\". (See -- 'Gurdwaras Committee, Amritsar v. Indar Singh', AIR 1933 Lah 1041 (A), quoting from -- 'Mehr Singh v. Sochet Singh', AIR 1916 Lah 98 (B). It may be noticed that in the above proceedings the suit properties were claimed only as properties belonging to the main Gurdwara Darbar Sahib and not as by themselves constituting a Sikh Gurdwara and that the claim was compromised by admitting the title of the Raja but with an arrangement that the same should be held for the benefit of the pilgrims to the Darbar Sahib.\nQuite apart, however, from these proceedings, there appear to; have been certain prior proceedings under Section 7 of the Act initiated on an application by 57 Sikhs dated 24-10-1926, claiming these very properties as by themselves constituting a Sikh Gurdwara. The Government issued a notification dated 23-7-1929, under Section 7(3) of the Act. In the list attached to the application under Section 7(1) with reference to the provisions of Section 7(3) of the Act, the property was shown as being in possession of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Amritsar.\nTherefore, apart from the general notification, there does not appear to have been any service of individual notices under the provisions of Section 7(4) of the Act. Objections, however, were filed under Section 10 of the Act, by the two persons Nikka Singh and Suchet Singh, who had previously filed objections to the notification under Section 3(1). Both these objections appear to have been ultimately dismissed for default or non-prosecution more or less in the same way as their prior objections under Section 5(1). The Raja--the present plaintiff filed no objection under Section 10 claiming the alleged Gurdwara as his private property. This was presumably because he had no specific notice of this claim under Section 7.\nThere was no objection filed to the notification under Section 8 by any person. Notwithstanding the absence of any such objection no. notification under Section 9 was issued by the Government. It may be mentioned that from the date of the compromise in 1933 up to some time in the year 1937-1938, the compromise appears to have been acted upon smoothly between the parties. It is stated, however, that some trouble, arose between them, as a result of which probably, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee moved the Provincial Government for issuing notification under Section 9 of the Act.\nOn 5-7-1938, the Provincial Government wrote a letter to the Raja asking\" him if he had any objection to the notification under Section 9 of the Act declaring the suit properties as a Sikh Gurdwara. The Raja strongly objected to any such notification being issued. Thereupon the Government refrained from issuing any notification under Section 9 of the Act and referred the Raja to the Civil Court on 2-11-1938. That is the genesis of the suit out of which the present appeal arises.\n4. The trial Court framed four preliminary issues as follows :\n\"1. Is the plaintiff in possession of the property in suit other than the shops?\n2. If this is not proved, can the suit proceed in the present form with respect to the above property?\n3. Has not this Court jurisdiction to try the suit?\n4. Is the suit barred by time?\" On issues Nos. 1 and 2, the Court held that a suit for declaration with regard to the property in dispute at the instance of the plaintiff was maintainable. But it decided issues Nos. 3 and 4 against the plaintiff and accordingly dismissed the suit. The first appellate Court, while maintaining the finding of the trial Court, on issues Nos. 1 and 2, held in favour of the plaintiff also on issues Nos. 3 and 4 and consequently remanded the case to. the trial Court for proceeding according to law and disposing of the case on its merits.\nAs already stated, the appeal to the High Court was in two stages, first before a single Judge and thereupon by way of appeal under the Letters Patent. The findings in favour of the plaintiff so far as issues Nos. 1, 2 and 4 are concerned do not appear to have been contested any further in the High Court. The controversy was confined to the question of jurisdiction raised in issue No. 3. It may be mentioned that at the hearing of the Letters Patent Appeal in the High Court by the Bench who heard it for the second time, i.e., in the year 1950, a question appears to have been raised that on account of the death of one of the respondents during the pendency of the appeal and on account of his legal representatives not having been brought on the record, the appeal must be taken to. have abated as against all the respondents. This contention was overruled by the High Court.\nThat question has no longer been canvassed before us. The only substantial question, therefore, before the High Court was the question of jurisdiction raised in issue No. 3. To appreciate the contentions on either side relating to the question of jurisdiction in this appeal it is necessary briefly to notice the scheme of the Act.\n5. As its preamble shows, the Act was meant to provide for the better administration of certain Sikh Gurdwaras and for inquiries into matters and settlement of disputes connected therewith. Part III of the Act makes elaborate provisions for the control and administration of Sikh Gurdwaras through a Central Board, a Judicial Commission, and various Local Committees to be constituted in accordance with the provisions of that part.\nUnder Section 41 of the Act the management of every Notified Sikh Gurdwara is to be administered by the Committee constituted therefore, the Board and the Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Act. A Notified Sikh Gurdwara is defined as meaning any Gurdwara declared by Notification of the Provincial Government, under the provisions of the Act, to be a Sikh Gurdwara. The provisions relating to the notification and the machinery for settlement of disputes preliminary to such Notification are found in Part I.\nThe provisions in Part I are based on a legislative classification of Gurdwaras contained in Schedules I and II of the Act. The Gurdwaras enumerated in Schedule I are all of them Sikh Gurdwaras. Schedule II enumerates certain institutions which are not Sikh Gurdwaras. Sections 3 to 6 of the Act relate to Gurdwaras in Sch. I. Section 3(1) provides that any Sikh or any present office-holder of a Gurdwaras specified in Sch. I may forward to the Provincial Government within ninety days from the commencement of the Act, a list of properties claimed to belong to the said Gurdwara situated in Punjab, inclusive of the Gurdwara, and the names of the persons in possession thereof.\nSection 3(2) provides that on receiving any list the Provincial Government shall publish a notification that the Gurdwara to which it relates is a Sikh Gurdwara and shall also later on publish a consolidated list showing the properties mentioned in the various lists that may be received under Sub-section  (1). Sub-section (3) if Section 3 provides for notice of the claim, as appears from the consolidated list, to such of the persons named therein as being in possession.\nOn the publication of the notification and of the consolidated list under Sub-section  (2), the provisions of Part III relating to administration are applied with effect from the date of the publication. Now Section 5 provides that on the publication of a notifications of Section 3(2) and within ninety days thereafter any person claiming a right, title or interest in any property included in the consolidated list except a right, title or interest in the Gurdwara itself may forward a petition to the Provincial Government.\nWhere, no such claim is received under Section 5(1), then the Provincial Government is enjoined under Sub-section  (3) of Section 5, to publish as soon as it may be, after the expiry of the prescribed period for making a claim, a notification specifying the right, title or interest in any properties in respect of which no such claim has been made. It is also provided that the publication of the notification shall be conclusive proof of the fact that no such claim was made in respect of any right, title or interest specified in the notification. Section 6 refers to claim for compensation by hereditary office-holders in respect of a Sikh- Gurdwara notified as above.\n6. The next group of sections, i.e., sections 7 to 11 of the Act relate to Gurdwaras (alleged as such) other than those enumerated in Sch. I and II. Section 7 provides that any 50 worshippers of a Gurdwara may forward an application to the Provincial Government claiming that it is a Sikh Gurdwara. Such a petition should be accompanied by a list showing all the properties belonging thereto including (the item of property which constitutes) the Gurdwara.\nOn receipt of such an application, the Provincial Government has under Section 7(3) to. publish the same along with the accompanying list by a notification and has also to give notice to the parties concerned. On the publication of such a notification three different kinds of claims may be forwarded to the Provincial Government, (a) tinder Section 8 by any hereditary office-holder of the Gurdwara or any 20 or more worshippers of the Gurdwara objecting that the Gurdwara is not a Sikh Gurdwara. (b) Under Section 10 by any person claiming his own right, title to, or interest in any item of property in the list published.\n(c) Under Section 11 by any past or present hereditary office-holder of the Gurdwara claiming- compensation for loss suffered or to be suffered. Section 9 provides that if, after a notification under Section 7(3) is published, no petition is received within ninety days thereof under Section 8 objecting to its being declared a Sikh Gurdwara, the Provincial Government shall, after the expiration of. the prescribed period, publish a notification declaring the Gurdwara to be a Sikh Gurdwara. The machinery for the determination of the various claims arising with reference to Section 3 to 11 is provided in Section 12 and 14.\nSection 12 provides that for the purpose of deciding all the claims made in accordance with the above mentioned provisions of the Act, the Provincial Government may from time to time constitute one or more Tribunals. Section 14 enjoins that the Provincial Government shall forward to a Tribunal all petitions received by it under the provisions of Section 5, 6, 8, 10 or 11 and that the Tribunal shall dispose of such petitions, by order, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\nThus it may be seen that these sections in Part-I taken with Schedules I and II of the Act provide broadly for (1) determination and notification of what are Sikh Gurdwaras, (2) determination of what are the properties which belong to , each of these Sikh Gurdwaras, (3) determination of compensation for office-holders of such. Gurdwaras for loss they may sustain on the notification of the Gurdwaras as Sikh Gurdwaras, and (4) setting up of Tribunals for the disposal of various claims relating to the above disputes.\nSection 34 provides for an appeal to the High Court from the determination by a Tribunal. Sections 29, 30, 31 and 37 indicate the demarcation of jurisdiction relating to these disputes as between the Tribunals under the Act and the ordinary Civil Courts. These sections will be noticed presently.\n7. Now the question of jurisdiction in this case arises as follows. The argument on behalf of the appellant is that the claim to the suit property made by the plaintiff in this suit could and should have been put forward as an objection under Section 10 of the Act and that such a question is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sikh Gurdwara Tribunal. For the respondent it is contended that no such claim could have been maintained under Section 10 of the Act and that Section 7 to 11 proceed on a basic assumption that there is a Gurdwara in respect of which claims as to. its character are allowed to be put forward and objections as to what properties belong to it are admissible.\nIt is urged that the determination of the correctness of that basic assumption is not within the scope of decision by a Gurdwara Tribunal and that the question as to whether a certain item of property is the private property of a person or by itself constitutes a Gurdwara at all is one to be decided by the Civil Court, when the question is raised. We have heard elaborate arguments on these questions and have had the benefit of the views expressed by the. learned Judges of the High Court in their respective judgments in this case.\nThe decision of the questions thus raised is not altogether easy in View of the rather involved and defective drafting of the relevant sections of the Act. After giving our best consideration, we feel it unnecessary and undesirable to express any opinion on the questions so raised. In our view on the facts of this case, the decision of this appeal can be rested on narrower grounds.\n8. Assuming without deciding that the contention put forward on behalf of the appellant is correct, viz., that the claim of the plaintiff in the present case is one that should have been put forward under Section 10, this does not by itself conclude the question of jurisdiction. The exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in respect of such a claim must be brought about by some specific provisions in the Act. The provision that has been relied on in this behalf is Section 29 which is as follows:\n\"29. Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law or enactment for the time being in force no suit shall be instituted and no Court shall entertain or continue any suit or proceeding in so far as such suit or proceeding involves--\n(1) any claim to, or prayer for the restoration of any person to an office in a Notified Sikh Gurdwara or any prayer for the restoration or establishment of any system of management of a Notified Sikh Gurdwara other than a system of management established under the provisions of Part III;\n(2) any claim to, or prayer for the restoration of any person to an office in or any prayer for the restoration or establishment of any system of management of, any Gurdwara in respect of which a notification has been published in accordance with the provisions of Sub-section  (3) of Section 7 unless and until it has been decided under the provisions of Section 16 that such Gurdwara should not be declared to be a Sikh Gurdwara\".\nSection 29 (1) has obviously no application since the disputed property in this case has not been notified under Section 9 of the Act and is not a '\"Notified Sikh Gurdwara\" within the meaning of the Act. This is not disputed. It is pointed out that it is Section 29(2) which applies to the case since a notification under Section 7(3) has been published in respect of this alleged Sikh Gurdwara. It is urged that this sub-section applies to (and hence bars the cognizance of the Civil Court as regards) \"any claim to.............any (such) Gurdwara\".\nOn the construction of Section 29(2) the learned Judges of the High Court have, in these proceedings, expressed different views. Justice Abdul Rashid has accepted a reading of this section which supports the appellant's contention. Justice Kapur has adopted a different reading and has negatived the contention. It is not necessary for our purpose  to  resolve  even  this  limited  conflict of views.\nWhichever reading is accepted as correct, the only result that follows under this sub-section is that the Court shall not \"entertain the claim or continue the suit unless and until it has been decided under the provisions of section 16 that such Gurdwara should not be- declared to be a Sikh Gurdwara\", The reference to Section 16 in the clause underlined above (here in ' ') is obviously to a proceeding before a Sikh Gurdwara Tribunal in which the limited issue as to whether the Gurdwara is or is not a Sikh Gurdwara has got to be decided as a preliminary issue by virtue of Section 16.\nNow the only provisions in the Act under which any proceeding which may involve the determination of the above issue can come up before the Tribunal are Sections 14 and 32. (It may be noted that the only other sections under which a Tribunal gets any seisin of any other proceeding are Sections 19, 20, 21 and 27 but they have no relevance to the, present case). Hence the clause \"unless and until it has been decided under the provisions of Section 16 that such Gurdwara should not be declared a Sikh Gurdwara\" appears clearly to apply to a situation where proceedings involving the determination of the issue of \"Gurdwara or Sikh Gurdwara\" come up before the Tribunal by virtue of Section 14 or Section 32.\nBut, on the facts of the present case, the situation is one to which neither Section 32 nor Section 14 can apply. Section 32 does not apply since the alleged Gurdwara has not been notified under Section 9 and is not a \"Notified Sikh Gurdwara\". Section 14 does not apply because there is no petition under Section 10 which has been or should have been sent up to the Tribunal. If, therefore, as contended for on behalf of the appellant, Section 29(2) be held to apply to the present case, it will at best lead to the anomalous situation of the exercise of the Civil Court's jurisdiction being barred or stayed indefinitely, and interminably.\nIt is to be noticed that the language in Section 29 viz., \"no court shall entertain or continue any suit or proceeding\" is not of adequate amplitude to effectively exclude the jurisdiction of the Court but that it only prohibits its exercise \"unless and until\" a specified issue is decided under Section 16 (presumably by the Tribunal). The effect of Section 29(2) being, not to exclude jurisdiction, but to operate only as a limited stay until a specific issue is determined by the Tribunal, we cannot hold that it applies to a case like the present one where there is no scope for the determination of such an issue by the Tribunal under the prescribed machinery of the Act, with reference to the situation that has transpired in the case.\nThe exclusion of jurisdiction of the Civil Court in respect of a suit or an issue which is normally within its competence can be brought about only by clear and unambiguous language or by the necessary implication thereof.\n9. It is desirable to notice, in passing, two other sections in the Act, viz., Sections 30 and 31 in this connection, though they have not been in terms relied upon as bringing about a bar of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in this case. It is sufficient to say that Section 30 has no application because the present case does not relate to a \"Notified Sikh Gurdwara\" and that Section 31(2) which might possibly be contended to apply, can also have no application for the same reasons which have been mentioned above in considering Section 29(2).\n10. In our opinion, therefore, the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in respect of the issues that arise for determination in this case is not barred by any of the provisions of the Act.\n11. The learned Judges of the High Court in the judgment under appeal have recorded the following conclusions towards the close of their judgment.\n\"1. That unless the institution is a Gurdwara no claim can be made under Section 7(1) by 50 Sikh worshippers, and no notification can issue;\n2. That in this case the notification of 23-7-1929, under Section 7(1) was inconsistent with the claim made and published in the notification under Section 3(2) dated 13-12-1927;\n3. That as a result of a previous adjudication dated 17-6-1933, the building in dispute in the present case is neither a Gurdwara nor a Sikh Gurdwara but merely private property of the plaintiff; and\n \n\n4. That neither Section 29 nor Section 31 of the Act is a bar to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court, and that if Section 29 bars any claim to a Gurdwara, then the necessary consequence of this finding will be that there will be no Court competent to try the question whether a particular institution is or is not a Gurdwara\".\nWe have expressed our opinion about item No, 4 above agreeing with the conclusion stated, though not for the same reasons, which have appealed to the learned Judges. So far as the conclusion Nos. 1 and 2 are concerned they have a bearing . only on the question whether the proceedings initiated under Section 7 of the Act in the present case are valid so as to bring about the application of Section 10 to the plaintiff's claim and the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court consequent thereupon, in respect of that claim.\nIn the view we have taken on the question of jurisdiction, while leaving the applicability of Section 10 open, it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the questions involved in conclusions Nos. 1 and 2 recorded by the High Court and they are accordingly vacated. Conclusion No. 3 remains to be considered and it is based on Section 37 of the Act. In view of the course we are proposing to adopt, it is unnecessary to deal at this stage with the effect of Section 37 on this case with reference to the previous history.\nAll that we need say at present is that the learned Judges, Laving remanded the suit and certain issues of fact on the merits still remaining to be determined, should not have virtually concluded the decision of the suit by a finding of the nature which they have recorded. We accordingly vacate also conclusion No. 3 of the learned Judges and leave it open for further consideration.\n12. As has been stated at the outset, the suit lias been disposed of in the Courts below only on the preliminary issues. The only one of the preliminary issues which survived up to this stage was the one relating to jurisdiction. We have now held finally that, on the facts of this case, the Civil Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the suit which has been instituted and to decide the material issues raised therein.\nOn the pleadings in this case the two: questions on the merits that arise are (1) Is the compromise decree dated 17-6-1933 of the Sikh Gurdwara Tribunal in the proceedings arising out of the claim of the plaintiff under Section 5 of the Act, binding as between the parties to the present suit? (2) If not, do the properties in the suit belong to the plaintiff as claimed by him? We consider it necessary and desirable to call for findings from the trial Court on these two issues before finally disposing of this appeal.\n13. The question that remains for further consideration is as to the maintainability of this appeal before us on the certificate granted by the High Court. As has been stated, at the outset, this has been raised as a preliminary objection. The High Court granted the certificate under Sections 109 and 110 and Order 45, Rule 2, Civil P. C., read with Article  133 of the Constitution.\nThe question raised is that since what all the High Court did was to remand the suit to the trial Court for proceeding in accordance with law, there is no final order within the meaning of the above provisions against which a certificate could be granted by the High Court. The learned Judges have considered the matter and have pointed out that though the order purports to be by way of a remand they did in fact finally decide the matter. They say as follows :\n\"It was finally decided that the building in dispute was merely a private property and it was neither a Gurdwara nor a Sikh Gurdwara and that no claim could be made by the 56 worshippers merely because it was a Gurdwara and that the notification of 1929 was inconsistent with the notification under Section 3 of 1927. The decision on these three points finally determines the rights of the parties in regard to the ownership of the property.\nIf it is private property, as it has been held by this Court, then a declaration must be given as prayed for by the plaintiff and as a consequence the injunction will follow\".\nIn fact this was the very view of the effect of that order which has been taken by the trial Court after remand. In deference to this views the trial Court did nothing except passing a decree in terms of this order. There is, therefore, no substance in the preliminary objection. On the facts of this case the judgment of the High Court appealed against does amount to a final order.\nBut it is further urged that since a decree has already followed upon this remand in favour of the plaintiff and since no appeal has been filed as against the decree so passed, that determination has now become conclusive and prevents us from dealing with this appeal and setting aside or modifying the judgment of the High Court and making a fresh remand to that Court ourselves. We are not able to accept this contention in the circumstances of this case.\nThe application to the High Court for leave to appeal was filed on 23-9-1950 and leave was granted on 18-7-1952. The decree of the trial Court after remand was passed, in between, on 4-12-1951. The decree must, in the circumstances, be taken to be subject to the result of this appeal. In our opinion this case falls within the principle recognised by. the Privy Council in --'Shama Purshad v. Hurro Purshad', 10 Moo Ind App 203 (PC) (C), and not that in -- 'Nanganna Naidu v. Venkatapayya', AIR 1923 PC .167 (D).\n14. We accordingly direct the trial Court to take such further evidence as may be necessary and submit to this Court its findings on the two issues above stated within three months from the date of receipt of the records by that court. On receipt of the finding in this Court it will be open to either side to, file objections thereto within ten days therefrom and this appeal will be thereafter posted for final disposal.\n"}, {"id": "115297", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "N.

Four persons, including the two appellants, were prosecuted at the instance of a private complainant for offences alleged by him to have been committed under Sections 448, 427, 380, 166 and 114, I.P.C.\n2. All four were acquitted by the learned trying Magistrate.   The complainant applied in revision against the acquittals to the High Court.  Chunder, J. issued rules against three of the accused but refused to issue one against the fourth.   His acquittal therefore stood. Later, when the revision was heard, also by Chunder, J., he upheld the acquittal of one of the  three  accused  against  whom   the  rule was issued but set aside the acquittals of the other two and remanded the case for a retrial.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was granted by two other Judges of the Calcutta High Court.\n3. The only question we have to consider is whether Chunder, J., observed and applied the law about setting aside acquittals in revision at the instance of a private party. There are three decisions in point, namely, -- 'D. Stephens v. Nosibolla', ; -- 'Logendranath Jha v. Polailal Biswas',  and -- 'Harihar Chakravarty v. State of West Bengal', .\n4. The facts are these. The first accused is the landlord of certain premises. The complainant arid one Sarojini Dasi are his tenants while Bacha-ram Khatua (P. W. 2), Gunadhar Sasmal (P. W. 4) and Paban Chandra Mikap (P. W. 6) are subtenants of the complainant. The first accused obtained a decree against Sarojini authorising him to demolish certain huts in her possession. The decree was executed on 13-8-1952 at 5-30 P. M. and in the process of demolition, huts belonging to the complainant, and also to Bacharam Khatua (P. W. 2), Gunadhar Sasmal (P. W. 4) and Paban Chandra Mikap (P. W. 6), were damaged.\nThe complainant's case is that the first accused and his two sons were present and also the bailiff and that the damage to the other huts was deliberately caused at the instigation of the first accused and his two sons, the second and third accused. According to the complainants the coolies acted under the directions of the four accused when they first began to start work on these other houses.\nThey desisted for a short time when these other persons, including the complainant, protested. But after putting their heads together for a time all four accused directly and deliberately told the coolies to damage these other huts.\n5. It is admitted on all hands that the huts in question were damaged but the accused say that this was due to a mistake made by the coolies because the huts stand cheek by jowl and the coolies did not realise that they were not to touch those other huts when they started to work on them. As soon as the accused realised what was happening they at once stopped the work.\n6. The learned trying Magistrate believed this version and disbelieved that part of the complainant's evidence which suggests that the damage was done at the instance and instigation of the accused. He therefore held that no criminal offence was committed because there was no intention proved.\n7. Chunder, J. held that the theory of mistake was negatived by two facts. First, because under the procedure of the Civil Courts, when executing a decree the execution does not start until somebody on the decree-holder's side identifies the property. And secondly, because the fact that as many as four wrong huts were damaged makes it unlikely that that was done by mistake. The learned Judge also thought that there was evidence of motive that required consideration.\n8. Now it may well, be that a different view of this evidence could have been taken but that is not enough to justify interference in revision when there is an application by a private party to set aside an order of acquittal. It has to be remembered that no right of appeal is conferred in such cases though there is provision for appeal against acquittals.\nCourts must therefore use their revisional powers very sparingly. This has been explained so often in this Court (and now we have three reported rulings) that we need not dilate on it again. The following facts stand out on a cursory glance through the depositions of the witnesses.\n9. First, there is no direct evidence of prior instigation, that is to say, prior to the time when the coolies first began to cause the damage. Secondly, P. Ws. 2, 4 and 6 all agree that when the complainant and the other tenants protested the accused told the coolies to stop. Thirdly, that after a consultation among themselves, all four accused instigated the coolies to damage these huts and that they themselves, actively participated and assisted. Niroda Dasi (P. W. 3) also implicates all four of the accused.\n10. Now the evidence is simple and the witnesses do not differentiate between any of the accused and say that one did more than any other. Despite that the learned Judge refused to issue a rule against the bailiff. It may be that his case can be distinguished because he would not be likely to know the facts personally and would have to depend on what the other three accused told him, but the case of the father of the two sons cannot be distinguished from that of the sons on this evidence because not a single eye-witness differentiates between them.\nBut Chunder, J. himself did not regard the evidence sufficient against the father though how he differentiated between his case and that of the sons he does not disclose. Lastly, there is this glaring fact. P. Ws. 2 and 6 admit that the officer in charge of the police thana was there but say that nobody complained to him, at least P. W. 2 identifies him as the officer in charge while P. W. 6 merely says a police officer. We find it impossible to hold that a judicial mind could not reasonably disbelieve this evidence in the face of these facts.\n11. In any case, Chunder, J. has not applied his mind to the law laid down by this Court. He has not adverted to any of the factors which these decisions say must be found to be present before interference is called for. We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside Chunder, J.'s order and restore that of the trying Magistrate acquitting the two appellants.\n"}, {"id": "489768", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "Dasrath Gond And Ors. vs State Of Orissa on 15 March, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member services -- Free for one month.JUDGMENT\n \n\nJagannadhadas, J.\n1. This appeal has been admitted only on the question of sentence. The relevant facts can be gathered from the following extract from the judgment of the High Court:\n\"The twelve appellants and seven other persons were placed on trial before the learned Sessions Judge for an offence under Section 302/149, I. P. C. on the allegation that on 25-2-1952 they, in furtherance of their common object, murdered one Madan Sahu of their village. The motive for the murder was said to be their belief that Madan Sahu was a Pungnia (sorcerer) who was mainly responsible for the prevalence of small pox in the village. The parties belong to village Badimal P.S. Brajarajnagar, in an interior part of Sambalpur district.\nIt appears that in the early part of the year 11952 small pox epidemic was prevalent in a virulent form in the village and the efforts of the villagers to drive away the epidemic with the help of Bejis (charmers) proved fruitless. The Bejis then informed the villagers that their Mantras were all rendered ineffective because one of the villagers was himself a Pungnia and was counteracting the effect of their Mantras. Thereupon the villagers grew alarmed and on 16-1-52 met in a body and executed a document (Ex. 8) agreeing to beat any one who was found to be a Pungnia.\nThe deceased, some of the appellants and the Gaontia of the village signed that document. Several other villagers also either signed it or gave their thumb impressions. As the epidemic showed no signs of abatement it was alleged that on 25-2-52 the appellants and some other villagers, suspecting that deceased Madan Sahu was the Pungnia, brought him to the Bhagbatghar of the village and asked him to take oath before the deity to the effect that he was not the Pungnia responsible for the small pox in the village.\nMadan refused to take the oath first and there was an altercation between him and some of the appellants. He then tried to leave the Bhagbatghar but he was caught hold of by some of the appellants and severaly belaboured with first blows and kicks. His son Lokanath Sahu (P. W. 4) and his widow Indumati Sahuani (P. W. 8) attempted to. save him; but they were pushed out by some of the appellants.\nIt was alleged that after thus severely assaulting Madan in the Bhagbatghar itself the culprits carried him to the courtyard of appellant Chintamoni close by and continued to beat him there till he died. Then his corpse was taken away and thrown in a jungle close to the village.\"\n2. The accused were all committed to take their trial before the Sessions Judge on charges under Sections 302/149/120B/201, I. P. C. Seven of the accused were acquitted. The remaining 12 were convicted under Sections 325/149 & 120, I.P.C. and acquitted in respect of Section 302/149 & Section 201 I. P. C. In respect of the convictions under Section 325/149, each was sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment and in respect of the convictions under Section 120, I. P. C, no separate sentences were awarded. These twelve went up in appeal to the High Court.\nAt the commencement of the hearing of the appeal a rule was issued by the High Court to show cause why the sentence against each should not be enhanced. Both the appeal and the motion for enhancement were finally argued together. The learned Judges of the High Court after discussing the merits of the case and considering the evidence and the probabilities confirmed the convictions in respect of eleven persons and enhanced their sentences from three years' R. I. to seven years' R. I. for each.\nOne other person who was also an appellant was given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted. The High Court has also noted that it was reported that one out of the eleven was dead but that they were not sure about it. However that may be, only eight out of these eleven persons appear to have applied to this Court for special leave and they are the petitioners before us.\n3. The judgment of the High Court shows that in enhancing the sentences the learned Judges were mainly influenced by their view of the facts that the offence committed by the appellants before them in fact constituted murder under Section 302 I. P. C. and not merely grievous hurt under Section 325, I.P.C.\nWhether this view is correct or not is not material since there has been no appeal by the Government against the acquittal and the High Court maintained the convictions only under Section 325/149, I. P. C. We agree entirely with the learned Judges of the High Court that, taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, the sentence of three years' rigorous imprisonment awarded by the learned Sessions Judge was inadequate.\nThe post-mortem examination of the corpse of the deceased person showed that there were ten injuries all over the body as stated by the High Court in the following passage:\n\"The post-mortem examination on the corpse of Madan Sahu was held by Dr. S.C. Rout (P. W. 5) who found ten injuries all over the body. Some of the injuries were lacerated wounds on the left side and the right side of the head. There were contusion all over the face, neck, thorax and abdomen. The right leg from the knee downwards was broken at its middle. On dissection, the Medical Officer found the lower jaw fractured and several ribs Broken. The pleurae were also found torn at six places below fractured ribs.\nThe right lung was also lacerated. All these injuries appeared to be ante-mortem and death was due to shock and haemorrhage resulting from the thoracic wounds caused by some hard substance or a blunt weapon like a lathi or by fist blows or kicks. Though a portion of the body had been eaten away by wild animals the Medical Officer's opinion regarding the ante-mortem nature of the injuries as described above was not challenged.\" \nIf is clear that this was a brutal attack by several persons in a fit of superstition relating to suspected sorcery. The circumstances in which this attack was made calls for a deterrent sentence. We do not, therefore, feel called upon to interfere.\n4. This appeal must accordingly be dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "1234664", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "Shiromani Gurdwara ... vs Lt.

It is a part  of\nthe  law of the land which cannot be finally  determined  or\naltered\t by any tribunal of limited jurisdiction.  The\tHigh\nCourts\tand the Supreme Court alone can determine  what\t the\nlaw of the land is vis-a-vis all other Courts and  tribunals\nand they alone can pronounce with authority and finality  on\nwhat  is  legal\t and  what is not.   All  that\tan  inferior\ntribunal can do is to reach a tentative conclusion which  is\nsubject\t to  review  under  Articles  226  and\t136  of\t the\nConstitution.\tThe  jurisdiction of the High  Courts  under\nArticle 226, with that of the Supreme Court above them,\t re-\nmain  it-,  fullest  extent  despite  section  105  of\t the\nRepresentation\n2\nof  the\t People Act.  Limitations on the exercise  of,\tsuch\njurisdiction can only be imposed by the Constitution.\nThe  powers  of\t the High Courts under Article\t226  of\t the\nConstitution are discretionary and, though no limits can  be\nplaced\tupon  that discretion, it must\tbe  exercised  along\nrecognised  lines and not arbitrarily.\tIn the\texercise  of\ntheir jurisdiction under Article 226, the High Courts should\nnot  act  as Courts of Appeal or revision  to  correct\tmere\nerrors of law which do not occasion injustice in a broad and\ngeneral sense.\tIt is a sound exercise of discretion to bear\nin mind the policy of the legislature to have disputes about\nspecial rights, as in election cases, decided as speedily as\nmay  be.   The High Courts should  not\ttherefore  entertain\npetitions  for\tprerogative writs lightly in this  class  of\ncase.\nThe  appellant filed an election petition under section\t 100\nof  the Representation of the People -Act.  He\tappeared  on\nthe first and 'Subsequent hearing at Kotah.  The proceedings\nwere  then adjourned for certain hearings at  Udaipur.\t The\nappellant did not appear on the first three hearings at that\nplace  so  the\ttribunal proceeded ex  parte.\tHis  counsel\nappeared  on the fourth hearing but was not allowed to\ttake\nany  further part in the proceedings because no\t good  cause\nwas shown for the earlier non-appearance and so the tribunal\nrefused to set aside its \"ex parte order\".\nHeld,  (1) Under section 90(2) of the Representation of\t the\nPeople Act the procedure for the trial of election petitions\nis  to\tbe, as near as may be, the same as in the  trial  of\nsuits under the Civil Procedure Code;\n(2)  under  the Civil Procedure Code there is no such  thing\nas  an\tex parte order for non-appearance\"  which  precludes\nfurther\t appearance at an adjourned hearing until the  Order\nis  set aside.\tIf a party appears at an  adjourned  hearing\nthe  court  has\t a  discretion\t(which\tmust  be   exercised\njudicially) either to allow him to appear oil such terms  as\nit thinks fit, or to disallow further appearance; but\n(3)  if\t he is allowed to appear then, unless good cause  is\nshown  under Order 9, rule 7 for the earlier  non-appearance\nthe  proceedings must continue from the stage at  which\t the\nlater  appearance  is  entered and the\tparty  so  appearing\ncannot\tbe relegated to the position he would have  occupied\nif he had appeared at the earlier hearing or hearings; also,\n(4)  in\t exercising its discretion the court must  see\tthat\njustice is done to all concerned, including the witnesses\nRule  6\t (1) (a) of Order 9 of the Civil Procedure  Code  is\nconfined  to  the  first hearing of the suit  and  does\t not\napply,\tper  se to subsequent hearings. 0. 9, r. 7  gives  a\nparty a right to be relegated to the position he would\thave\noccupied  if  he  had appeared at  the\tearlier\t hearing  or\nhearings if he shows good cause.  It does not per se prevent\nfurther appearance when no good cause is shown.\t O. 17, r. 2\napplies\t at  the adjourned hearing and there, the  Court  is\ngiven a wide discretion to make such order as it thinks fit.\n3\nA code of procedure is a body of law designed to  facilitate\njustice\t and further its ends, and should not be treated  as\nan  enactment providing for punishments and penalties.\t The\nlaws  of procedure are grounded on the principle of  natural\njustice\t which\trequires that men should  not  be  condemned\nunheard,  that decisions should not be reached behind  their\nbacks, that proceedings that affect their lives and property\nshould\tnot continue in their absence and that\tthey  should\nnot  be\t precluded from participating in them.\t Subject  to\nclearly\t defined exceptions the laws of procedure should  be\nconstrued wherever reasonably possible, in the light of that\nprinciple.   The court is invested with the widest  possible\ndiscretion to see that justice is done to all concerned.  No\nhard  and fast rule can be laid down; and the court  in\t the\nexercise  of its judicial discretion will have, in  a  given\ncase, to determine what consequences are to follow from non-\nappearance.  An order awarding costs, or an adjournment,  or\nthe  consideration of the written statement and the  framing\nof  the issues on the spot, can in some cases meet the\tends\nof  justice.   In other cases, more drastic  action  may  be\ncalled for.\nBy  \"ends  of  justice\" is meant not  only  justice  to\t the\nparties\t but  also  to\twitnesses  and\tothers\twho  may  be\ninconvenienced.\t  The  convenience of the  witnesses,  which\ndeserves  the  greatest consideration,\tis  ordinarily\tlost\nsight  of in this class of case.  Justice strongly.  demands\nthat  this  unfortunate section of the general\tpublic\tcom-\npelled\tto  discharge  public duties, usually  at  loss\t and\ninconvenience  to  themselves should not be ignored  in\t the\nover-all  picture  of  what  will best\tserve  the  ends  of\njustice;  and it may well be a sound exercise of  discretion\nin a particular case to refuse an adjournment and permit the\nplaintiff to examine the witnesses present and not allow the\ndefendant  to  cross-examine them.   But  broadly  speaking,\nafter\tall  the  various  factors  have  been\ttaken\tinto\nconsideration and carefully weighed, the endeavour should be\nto  avoid  snap decisions and to afford the parties  a\treal\nopportunity of fighting out their cases fairly squarely.\nThe  Court must in every case exercise the discretion  given\nto  it.\t  Its hands are not tied by a  so-called  \"ex  parts\norder\", and, if it thinks they are tied by rule 7 of Order 9\nof the Code, then it is not exercising the discretion  which\nthe law says it should, and in a given case interference may\nbe called for.\nHeld,  that  the  Election Tribunal  did  not  exercise\t the\ndiscretion  given to it by law because of a  misapprehension\nthat  it  had  none.  It was directed to do so\tnow  and  to\nproceed\t with the further hearing of the case in  accordance\nwith law.\nHari  Vishnu v. Ahmed Ishaque ([1955] 1 S.C.R. 1104),  Darga\nShankar\t Mehta\tv.

It  is\nassumed\t that the title claimed by the person receiving\t the\nproperty under the arrangement had always resided in him  or\nher  so far as the property falling to his or her  share  is\nconcerned and therefore no conveyance is necessary.\nBut  in\t view of the fact that the Courts lean\tstrongly  in\nfavour of family arrangements that bring about harmony in  a\nfamily\tand do justice to its various members and avoid,  in\nanticipation, future disputes which might ruin them all\t the\nSupreme\t Court,\t carrying the principle further,  upheld  an\narrangement  under  which one set of  members  abandons\t all\nclaim  to  all title and interest in all the  properties  in\ndispute and acknowledges that the sole and absolute title to\nall  the  properties  resides in only one  of  their  number\n(provided  he or she had claimed the whole and made such  an\nassertion of title) and are content to take such  properties\nas  are\t assigned to their shares as gifts pure\t and  simple\nfrom  him or her, or as a conveyance for consideration\twhen\nconsideration is present.\nThe  legal  position  in such a case  would  be\t this.\t The\narrangement or compromise would set out and define that\t the\ntitle claimed by A to all the properties in dispute was\t his\nabsolute  title as claimed and asserted by him and  that  it\nhad always resided in him.  Next, it would effect a transfer\nby A to B, C and D (the other members to the arrangement) of\nproperties X, Y and Z; and thereafter B, C and D would\thold\ntheir respective titles under the title derived from A.\t But\nin  that event, the formalities of law about the passing  of\ntitle\n23\nby transfer would have to be observed, and under the present\nstate of law either registration  or twelve  years'  adverse\npossession would be necessary.\t   But\tin the present\tcase\nthe arrangement was made in 1875 when\tthe   Transfer\t  of\nProperty  Act was not in force and no writing was  required;\nand  as there is no writing, the Registration Act  does\t not\napply either.  Therefore, the oral arrangement of 1875 would\nbe  sufficient\tto pass title in this way and that  is\twhat\nhappened.\nOnce  a reversioner has given his assent to  an\t alienation,\nwhether\t at  the time, or as a part of the  transaction,  or\nlater  as  a distinct and separate act, he is  bound  though\nothers may not be, and having given his assent he cannot  go\nback  on it to the detriment of other persons; all the\tmore\nso when he himself receives a benefit.\nIt is settled law that an alienation by a widow in excess of\nher  powers is not altogether void but only voidable by\t the\nreversioners,  who  may\t either\t singly\t or  as\t a  body  be\nprecluded from exercising their right to avoid it either  by\nexpress\t ratification or by acts which treat it as valid  or\nbinding.\nThe  principle\tapplicable  to the present case\t is  a\trule\nunderlying many branches of the law which precludes a person\nwho, with full knowledge of his rights, has once elected  to\nassent\tto  a transaction voidable at his instance  and\t has\nthus  elected  not to exercise his right to avoid  it,\tfrom\ngoing back on that and avoiding it at a later stage.  Having\nmade his election he is bound by it.\nHeld,  that  in\t the present case the plaintiff\t who  is  in\ntitulo\t now  that  the\t succession  has  opened  out,\t had\nunequivocally\tassented  to  the  arrangement\t with\tfull\nknowledge of the facts and accepted benefit under it, so  he\nis now precluded from avoiding it, and any attempts he\tmade\nto  go behind that assent when it suited his purpose  cannot\nrender\tthe  assent once given nugatory even though  it\t was\ngiven  when he was not in titulo and even though the  assent\nwas to a series of gifts.\nMst.

There  is  no warrant  for  confining  transfers\t \"by\noperation of law\" to the three cases of death, devolution or\nsuccession  or to transfers by operation of  statutory\tlaws\nonly.  If the document in question could be construed to  be\na  transfer of or an agreement to transfer the decree to  be\npassed\tin  future,  then on the  decree  being\t passed,  by\noperation  of  equity,\tthe  respondents  would\t become\t the\ntransferees  of\t the decree by operation of law\t within\t the\nmeaning of Order XXI, rule 16.\nPer  BHAGWATI J.-Section 5 of the Transfer of  Property\t Act\ndefines\t a  \"transfer of property\" as an act  by  which\t the\ntransferor  conveys property in present or in future to\t the\ntransferee  or\ttransferees.  The words \"in  present  or  in\nfuture\"\t qualify  the  word  \"conveys\"\tand  not  the\tword\n\"property\"  in the section.  A transfer of property that  is\nnot  in existence operates as a contract to be performed  in\nthe future which may be specifically enforced as soon as the\nproperty comes into existence.\tIt is only by the  operation\nof  this  equitable principle that as soon as  the  property\ncomes  into  existence and is capable of  being\t identified,\nequity\ttaking as done that which ought to be done,  fastens\nupon  the  property  and the contract to  assign  becomes  a\ncomplete  equitable  assignment.  There is  nothing  in\t the\nprovisions  of the Code of Civil Procedure or any other\t law\nwhich  prevents the operation of this  equitable  principle,\nand  an\t assignment in writing of a decree to be  passed  in\nfuture\twould become a complete equitable assignment on\t the\ndecree being passed and would fall within the \"assignment in\nwriting\" contemplated by Order XXI, rule 16 of the Code.\nA mere transfer of property as such does not by itself spell\nout  a transfer of a decree which has been passed or may  be\npassed\tin respect of that property and it would require  an\nassignment  of\tsuch  decree  in  order\t to  effectuate\t the\ntransfer.   But\t where the property is an  actionable  claim\nwithin\tthe  meaning of the definition in section 3  of\t the\nTransfer  of Property Act and is transferred by means of  an\ninstrument  in\twriting, the transferee could by  virtue  of\nsection\t 130 of the Transfer of Property Act step  into\t the\nshoes  of the transferor and claim to be the  transferee  of\nthe decree and apply for execution of the decree under Order\nXXI, rule 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nPer  IMAM  J.-There must be a decree in existence  which  is\ntransferred  before  the  transferee can  benefit  from\t the\nprovisions\n\t\t\t    1371\nof  rule 16.  The ordinary and natural meaning of the  words\nof  rule  16  can  carry no  other  interpretation  and\t the\nquestion  of  a\t strict and  narrow  interpretation  of\t its\nprovisions does not arise.\nCase-law reviewed.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:\n"}, {"id": "292651", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "U.J.S.

He preferred an appeal to\t the\nHigh Court at Bombay, which was summarily dismissed.   After\nthe  dismissal\tof that appeal, the State of Bombay  made  a\nrevision   application\tto  the\t High  Court   praying\t for\nenhancement  of\t the  sentence.\t Notice was  issued  to\t the\nappellant under s. 439(2) of the Code of Criminal  Procedure\nto show cause against enhancement.\n95\nHeld  that the summary dismissal of the appeal preferred  by\nthe appellant did not preclude him from taking advantage  of\nthe  provisions\t of  s.\t 439(6)\t of  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure  and showing cause against his conviction when  he\nwas subsequently called upon to show cause why the  sentence\nimposed on him should not be enhanced.\n  Per  DAS J.-Sub-section (6) of section 439 of the Code  of\nCriminal Procedure confers a new and a valuable right on the\naccused.  The language used in sub-section (6) does not,  in\nterms, place any fetter on the right conferred by it on\t the\naccused.  This new right is not expressed to be\t conditioned\nor  controlled by anything that may have happened  prior  to\nthe   revision\t application  under  sub-section   (1)\t for\nenhancement  of sentence.  Therefore, whenever there  is  an\napplication for enhancement of sentence, a notice must issue\nunder  sub-section (2) to the accused person to\t show  cause\nand whenever such notice is issued, the accused person must,\nunder  sub-section (6), be given an opportunity, in  showing\ncause  against enhancement, also to show cause\tagainst\t his\nconviction.\nIt is not correct to say that sections 421, 435 & 439 of the\nCode give the court a discretion not to decide the appeal or\nrevision brought before it.  The discretion conferred on the\nHigh  Court  does not authorise it to say that it  will\t not\nlook at the appeal or revision. The Court's bounden duty  is\nto look into the appeal or revision and decide it,  although\nin  the\t process of arriving at its decision it has  a\tvery\nwide discretion.\nThere  is  no reason for holding that there is a  merger  or\nreplacement  of the Judgment of the trial Court into  or  by\nthe  Judgment  of  the High Court only when  the  appeal  or\nrevision  is  heard on notice to the respondent\t and  either\nallowed wholly or partially or dismissed but not when it  is\nheard  without\tnotice\tto  the\t respondent  and   dismissed\nsummarily;  for this purpose it makes no difference  whether\nthe  dismissal\tis  summary or otherwise,  and\tthere  is  a\njudgment of the High Court in all the three cases.  The only\ndifference  in substance is that in the first two cases\t the\njudgment is final qua both parties while in the third  case,\ni.e., when an appeal or revision by the accused is summarily\ndismissed without issuing notice to the State, the  judgment\nis  final only qua the accused who preferred the  appeal  or\nrevision.   This is based not on any technical\tdoctrine  of\nres  judicata, for there is none in criminal cases,  but  on\nthe general principle of finality of judgment.\tIn the first\ntwo  cases  there  can, after the judgment,  be\t no  further\napplication  by\t the State for enhancement of  sentence\t and\ntherefore  no question of the application of section  439(6)\ncan  arise.   In  the last case, i.e., in  case\t of  summary\ndismissal  the Judgment not being final qua the\t State,\t the\nState  may apply for enhancement of sentence and if it\tdoes\nthe accused becomes entitled again to show cause against his\nconviction  also  by  reason of the  special  provisions  of\nsection 439(6).\nPer BHAGWATI and IMAM JJ.-A Judgment pronounced by the\tHigh\nCourt in the exercise of its appellate or revisional\n96\njurisdiction  after issue of a notice and a full hearing  in\nthe presence of both the parties would certainly be  arrived\nat after due consideration of the evidence and all arguments\nand  would therefore be a final judgment and  such  judgment\nwhen  pronounced  would replace the judgment  of  the  lower\ncourt,\tthus  constituting  the only final  judgment  to  be\nexecuted  in accordance with law by the court  below.\tWhen\nhowever a petition of appeal presented by a convicted person\nfrom jail is summarily dismissed under s. 421 or a  revision\napplication made by him is dismissed summarily or in  limine\nwithout hearing him or his pleader what the High Court\tdoes\nin  such  a case is to refuse to entertain the\tpetition  of\nappeal\tor the revision application and the order passed  by\nthe High Court dismissed  or rejected\" cannot be said to  be\nan  expression of the opinion of the court arrived at  after\ndue consideration of the evidence and all the arguments.\nNo  notice for enhancement of sentence can be issued by\t the\nHigh Court when a judgment is pronounced by it after a\tfull\nhearing\t in  the  presence of both  the\t parties  either  in\nexercise  of its appellate or its  revisional  jurisdiction.\nSuch notice for enhancement of sentence can be issued by  it\neither\tsuo motu or at the instance of an  interested  party\nwhen  the  judgment of the lower court subsists and  is\t not\nreplaced  by its own judgment given in the exercise  of\t its\nappellate or revisional jurisdiction.

In October 1949 he\tmade\nan  application through an official of the Registered  Trade\nUnion-a person permitted by the authority under\t sub-section\n(2) of s. 15 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936-claiming\t his\nwages due in respect of six months from May to October 1949.\nThe respondent did not allege delay in the\n1354\npayment\t  of  his  wages  or  deduction\t of  his  wages\t  in\ncontravention of the provisions of s. 5 or s. 7 of Act IV of\n1936 respectively.  The respondent alleged that he had\tbeen\npaid his actual wages as fixed by the railway administration\nbut  that after the introduction of the scheme of  upgrading\nof persons employed under the daily wages scheme, others who\nwere  junior  to him had been placed on\t the  monthly  wages\nscheme\twhereas his claim to be so placed, had been  ignored\nand that he had not been paid wages on the scale to which he\nwould  have  been  entitled if he had  been  placed  on\t the\nmonthly wages scheme.\nHeld,  per SINHA J. (VIVIAN BosE and VENYATARAMA  AYYAR\t JJ.\nconcurring,   JAGANNADHADAS   J.   dissenting),\t  that\t the\nrespondent's complaint fell under the category of  potential\nwages  and  the\t authority appointed under the\tAct  had  no\njurisdiction to decide the question of potential wages.\t  It\nhad  the jurisdiction to decide what actually the  terms  of\nthe  contract between the parties were, that is to  say,  to\ndetermine the actual wages.\nOn  the case as made on behalf of the respondent, orders  of\nthe  superior officers were necessary to upgrade him from  a\ndaily wageearner to a higher cadre.  The authority under the\nAct  has  not been empowered under s. 15 to  make  any\tsuch\ndirection to the superior officers.\nPer  JAGANNADHADAS  J.-Undoubtedly  a  claim  to  a   higher\npotential  wage cannot be brought in under the\tcategory  of\n\"claim\tarising out of deduction from the wages or delay  in\npayment\t of  the  wages\"  if  that  wage  depended  on\t the\ndetermination by a superior departmental or other  authority\nas  to whether or not a particular employee is\tentitled  to\nthe higher wage-a determination which involves the  exercise\nof  administrative judgment or discretion or  certification,\nand which would, in such a situation, be a condition of\t the\npayability of the wage.\t But where the higher wage does\t not\ndepend\t upon\tsuch  determination  but  depends   on\t the\napplication of and giving effect to certain rules and orders\nwhich,\tfor this purpose, must be deemed to be\tincorporated\nin  the\t contract  of  employment, such\t a  wage  is  not  a\nprospective   wage  merely  because  the  paying   authority\nconcerned makes default or commits error in working out\t the\napplication  of\t the rules.  The wage under the Act  is\t not\nnecessarily  the  immediately  pre-existing  wage  but\t the\npresently  payable  wage.  Whether or not  an  employee\t was\nentitled to wages of a higher category than what he was till\nthen drawing would depend entirely on the scope of the rules\nwith reference to which he is entitled to become one in\t the\nhigher category and it cannot be assumed a priori that\tsuch\na claim is a claim to \"prospective wages\".\nOn the facts of the case as found the dispute as to the wage\nwas one that fell within the jurisdiction of the \"authority\"\nconcerned.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:\n"}, {"id": "549992", "date": "3/1955", "tagline": "Shivnandan Sharma vs The Punjab National Bank Ltd on 15 March, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nSHIVNANDAN SHARMA\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK LTD.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n15/03/1955\n\nBENCH:\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nBENCH:\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\n\nCITATION:\n 1955 AIR  404\t\t  1955 SCR  (1)1427\n\n\nACT:\nMaster\t and  servant-Banker-Agreement\tbetween\t  Bank\t and\nTreasurers-Treasurers,\t whether  servants  or\t independent\ncontractors -Cashier appointed by Treasurer-Whether  servant\nof the Bank.\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\nThe  appellant\twas  appointed head cashier in\tone  of\t the\nbranches  of the respondent Bank by the Treasurers who\twere\nin charge of the Cash Department of the Bank by virtue of an\nagreement  between them.

This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution, preferred by six persons, who purport to carry on the business of preparing, printing publishing and selling text books for different classes in the schools of Punjab, particularly for the primary and middle classes, under the name and style \"Uttar Chand Kapur & Sons.\" It is alleged that the Education Department of the Punjab Government has in pursuance of their so-called policy of nationalisation of text books, issued a series of notifications since 1950 regarding the printing, publication and sale of these books which have not only placed unwarrantable restrictions upon the rights of the petitioners to carry on their business but have practically ousted them and other fellow-traders from the business altogether. It is said that no restrictions could be imposed upon the petitioners' right to carry on the trade which is guaranteed under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution by mere executive orders without proper legislation and that the legislation, if any, must conform to the requirements of clause (6) of article 19 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the petitioners pray for writs in the nature of mandamus directing the Punjab Government to withdraw the notifications which have affected their rights.  \n 2. To appreciate the contentions that have been raised by the learned counsel who appeared for the parties before us, it will be necessary to narrate certain relevant facts. In the State of Punjab, all recognised schools have got to follow the course of studies approved by the Education Department of the Government and the use, by the pupils, of the text books prescribed or authorised by the Department is a condition precedent to the granting of recognition to a school. For a long period of time prior to 1950, the method adopted by the Government for selection and approval of text books for recognised schools was commonly known as the alternative method and the procedure followed was shortly this : Books on relevant subjects, in accordance with the principles laid down by the Education Department, were prepared by the publishers with their own money and under their own arrangements and they were submitted for approval of the Government. The Education Department after proper scrutiny selected books numbering between 3 and 10 or even more on each subject as alternative text books, leaving it to the discretion of the Head Masters of the different schools, to select any one of the alternative books on particular subject out of the approved list. The Government fixed the prices as well as the size and contents of the books and when these things were done it was left to the publishers to print, publish and sell the books to the pupils of different schools according to the choice made by their respective Head Masters. Authors, who were not publishers, could also submit books for approval and if any of their books were approved, they had to make arrangements for publishing the same and usually they used to select some one of the publishers already on the line to do the work.  \n 3. This procedure, which was in vogue since 1905, was altered in material particulars on and from May 1950. By certain resolutions of the Government passed on or about that time, the whole of the territory of Punjab, as it remained in the Indian Union after partition, was divided into three Zones. The text books on certain subjects like agriculture, history, social studies, etc., for all the zones were prepared and published by the Government without inviting them from the publishers. With respect to the remaining subjects, offers were still invited from \"publishers and authors\" but the alternative system was given up and only one text book on each subject for each class in a particular zone was selected. Another changes introduced at this time was that the Government charged, as royalty, 5% on the sale price of all the approved text books. The result therefore was that the Government at this time practically took upon themselves the monopoly of publishing the text books on some of the subjects and with regard to the rest also, they reserved for themselves a certain royalty upon the sale proceeds.  \n 4. Changes of a far more drastic character however were introduced in the year 1952 by a notification of the Education Department issued on the 9th of August, 1952 and it is against this notification that the complaints of the petitioners are mainly directed. This notification omitted the word \"publishers\" altogether and invited only the \"authors and others\" to submit books for approval by the Government. These \"authors and others, \" whose books were selected, had to enter into agreements in the form prescribed by the Government and the principal terms of the agreement were that the copyright in these books would vest absolutely in the Government and the \"authors and others\" would only get a royalty at the rate of 5% on the sale of the text books at the price or prices specified in the list. Thus the publishing, printing and selling of the books were taken by the Government exclusively in their own hands and the private publishers were altogether ousted from this business. The 5% royalty, in substance, represents the price for the sale of the copyright and it is paid to an author or any other person who, not being the author, is the owner of the copyright and is hence competent in law to transfer the same of the Government. It is against these notifications of 1950 and 1952 that the present petition under article 32 of the Constitution is directed and the petitioners pray for withdrawal of these notifications on the ground that they contravene the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under the Constitution.  \n 5. The contentions raised by Mr. Pathak, who appeared in support of the petitioners, are of a three-fold character. It is contended in the first place that the executive Government of a State is wholly incompetent, without any legislative sanction, to engage in any trade or business activity and that the acts of the Government in carrying out their policy of establishing monopoly in the business of printing and publishing text books for school students is wholly without jurisdiction and illegal. His second contention is, that assuming that the State could create a monopoly in its favour in respect of a particular trade or business, that could be done not by any executive act but by means of a proper legislation which should conform to the requirements of article 19(6) of the Constitution. Lastly, it is argued that it was not open to the Government to deprive the petitioners of their interest in any business or undertaking which amounts to property without authority of law and without payment of compensation as is required under article 31 of the Constitution.  \n 6. The first point raised by Mr. Pathak, in substance, amounts to this, that the Government has no power in law to carry on the business of printing or selling text books for the use of school students in competition with private agencies without the sanction of the legislature. It is not argued that the functions of a modern State like the police States of old are confined to mere collection of taxes or maintenance of laws and protection of the realm from external or internal enemies. A modern State is certainly expected to engage in all activities necessary for the promotion of the social and economic welfare of the community. What Mr. Pathak says, however, is, that as our Constitution clearly recognises a division of governmental functions into three categories, viz., the legislative, the judicial and the executive, the function of the executive cannot but be to execute the laws passed by the legislature or to supervise the enforcement of the same. The legislature must first enact a measure which the executive can then carry out. The learned counsel has, in support of this contention, placed considerable reliance upon articles 73 and 162 of our Constitution and also upon certain decided authorities of the Australian High Court to which we shall presently refer.  \n 7. Article 73 of the Constitution relates to the executive powers of the Union, while the corresponding provision in regard to the executive powers of a State is contained in article 162. The provisions of these articles are analogous to those of section 8 and 49 respectively of the Government of India Act, 1935 and lay down the rule of distribution of executive powers between the Union and the States, following the same analogy as is provided in regard to the distribution of legislative powers between them. Article 162, with which we are directly concerned in this case, lays down :  \n \"Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws :  \n Provided that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a State and Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of the State shall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power expressly conferred by this Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities thereof.\"   \n 8. Thus under this article the executive authority of the State is executive in respect to matters enumerated in List II of Seventh Schedule. The authority also extends to the Concurrent List except as provided in the Constitution itself or in any law passed by the Parliament. Similarly, article 73 provides that the executive powers of the Union shall extend to matters with respect to which the Parliament has power to made laws and to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by the Government of India by virtue of any treaty or any agreement. The proviso engrafted on clause (1) further lays down that although with regard to the matters in the Concurrent List the executive authority shall be ordinarily left to be State it would be open to the Parliament to provide that in exceptional cases the executive power of the Union shall extend to these matters also. Neither of these articles contain any definition as to what the executive function is and what activities would legitimately come within its scope. They are concerned primarily with the distribution of the executive power between the Union on the one hand and the States on the other. They do not mean, as Mr. Pathak seems to suggest, that it is only when the Parliament or the State Legislature has legislated on certain items appertaining to their respective lists, that the Union or the State executive, as the case may be, can proceed to function in respect to them. On the other hand, the language of article 162 clearly indicates that the powers of the State executive do extend to matters upon which the state Legislature is competent to legislate and are not confined to matters over which legislation has been passed already. The same principle underlies article 73 of the Constitution. These provisions of the Constitution therefore do not lend any support to Mr. Pathak's contention.  \n 9. The Australian cases upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel do not, in our opinion, appear to be of much help either. In the first (The Commonwealth and the Central Wool Committee v. The Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., 31 C.L.R. 421) of these cases, the executive Government of the Commonwealth, during the continuance of the war, entered into a number of agreements with a company which was engaged in the manufacture and sale of wool-tops. The agreements were of different types. By one class of agreements, the Commonwealth Government gave consent to the sale of wool-tops by the company in return for a share of the profits of the transactions (called by the parties \"a licence fee\"). Another class provided that the business of manufacturing wool-tops should be carried on by the company as agents for the Commonwealth in consideration of the company receiving an annual sum from the Commonwealth. The rest of the agreements were a combination of these two varieties. It was held by a Full Bench of the High Court that apart from any authority conferred by an Act of Parliament or by regulations thereunder, the executive Government of the Commonwealth had no power to make or rectify any of these agreement. The decision, it may be noticed, was based substantially upon the provision of section 61 of the Australian Constitution which is worded as follows :  \n  \"The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercised by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative and extends to the execution and maintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth.\"  \n 10. In addition to this, the King could assign other functions and powers to the Governor-General under section 2 but in this particular case no assignment of any additional powers was alleged or proved. The court held that the agreements were not directly authorised by the Parliament or under the provisions of any statute and as they were not for the execution and maintenance of the Constitution they must be held to be void. Isacs, J., in his judgment, dealt elaborately with the two types of agreements and held that the agreements, so far as they purported to bind the company to pay to the Government money, as the price of consents, amounted to the imposition of a tax and were void without the authority of Parliament. The other kind of agreements which purported to bind the Government to pay to the company a remuneration for manufacturing wool-tops was held to be an appropriation of public revenue and being without legislative authority was also void.  \n 11. It will be apparent that none of the principles indicated above could have any application to the circumstances of the present case. There is no provision in our Constitution corresponding to section 61 of the Australian Act. The Government has not imposed anything like taxation or licence fee in the present case nor have we been told that the appropriation of public revenue involved in the so-called business in text books carried on by the Government has not been sanctioned by the legislature by proper Appropriation Acts.  \n 12. The other case (Vide Attorney-General for Victoria v. The Commonwealth, 52 C.L.R. 533) is of an altogether different character and arose in the following way. The Commonwealth Government had established a clothing factory in Melbourne for the purpose of making naval and military uniforms for the defence forces and postal employees. In times of peace the operations of the factory included the supply of uniforms for other departments of the Commonwealth and for employees in various public utility services. The Governor-General deemed such peace-time operations of the factory necessary for the efficient defence of the Commonwealth inasmuch as the maintenance intact of the trained complement of the factory would assist in meeting wartime demands. A question arose as to whether operations of the factory for such purposes in peace-time were authorised by the Defence Act. The majority of the Court answered the question in the affirmative, Starke, J. delivered dissenting opinion upon which Mr. Pathak mainly relied. The learned Judge laid stress on section 61 of the Constitution Act according to which the executive power of the Commonwealth extended to the maintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth and held that there was nothing in the Constitution or any law of the Commonwealth which enabled the Commonwealth to establish and maintain clothing factories for other than Commonwealth purposes. The opinion, whether right or wrong, turns upon the particular facts of the case and upon the provision of section 61 of the Australian Act and it cannot and does not throw any light on the question that requires decision in the present case.  \n 13. A question very similar to that in the present case did arise for consideration before a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Motilal v. The Government of the State of Uttar Pradesh . The point canvassed there was whether the Government of a State has power under the Constitution to carry on the trade or business of running a bus service in the absence of a legislative enactment authorising the State Government to do so. Different views were expressed by different Judges on this question. Chief Justice Malik was of opinion that in a written Constitution like ours the executive power may be such as is given to the executive or is implied, ancillary or inherent. It must include all powers that may be needed to carry into effect the aims and objects of the Constitution. It must mean more than merely executing the laws. According to the chief Justice the State has a right to hold and manage its own property and carry on such trade or business as a citizen has the right to carry on, so long as such activity does not encroach upon the rights of others or is not contrary to law. The running of a transport business therefore was not per se outside the ambit of the executive authority of the State. Sapru, J., held that the power to run a Government bus service was incidental to the power of acquiring property which was expressly conferred by article 298 of the Constitution. Mootham and Wanchoo, JJ., who delivered a common judgment, were also of the opinion that there was no need for a specific legislative enactment to enable a State Government to run a bus service. In the opinion of these learned Judges an act would be within the executive power of the State if it is not an act which has been assigned by the Constitution of India to other authorities or bodies and is not contrary to the provisions of any law and does not encroach upon the legal rights of any member of the public. Agarwala, J., dissented from the majority view and held that the State Government had no power to run a bus service in the absence of an Act of the legislature authorising the State to do so. The opinion of Agarwala, J., undoubtedly supports the contention of Mr. Pathak but it appears to us to be too narrow and unsupportable.  \n 14. It may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of what executive function means and implies. Ordinarily the executive power connotes the residue of governmental functions that remain after legislative and judicial functions are taken away. The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the doctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but the functions of the different parts or branches of the Government have been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can very well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate assumption, by one organ or part of the State, of functions that essentially belong to another. The executive indeed can exercise the powers of departmental or subordinate legislation when such powers are delegated to it by the legislature. It can also, when so empowered, exercise judicial functions in a limited way. The executive Government, however, can never go against the provisions of the Constitution or of any law. This is clear from the provisions of article 154 of the Constitution but, as we have already stated, it does not follow from this that in order to enable the executive to function there must be a law already in existence and that the powers of executive are limited merely to the carrying out of these laws.  \n 15. The limits within which the executive Government can function under the Indian Constitution can be ascertained without much difficulty by reference to the form of the executive which our Constitution has set up. Our Constitution, though federal in its structure, is modelled on the British Parliamentary system where the executive is deemed to have the primary responsibility for the formulation of governmental policy and its transmission into law though the condition precedent to the exercise of this responsibility is its retaining the confidence of the legislative branch of the State. The executive function comprises both the determination of the policy as well as carrying it into execution. This evidently includes the initiation of legislation, the maintenance of order, the promotion of social and economic welfare, the direction of foreign policy, in fact the carrying on or supervision of the general administration of the State.  \n 16. In India, as in England, the executive has to act subject to the control of the legislature; but in what way is this control exercised by the legislature ? Under article 53(1) of our Constitution, the executive power of the Union is vested in the President but under article 75 there is to be a Council of Minister with the Prime Minister at the head to aid advise the President in the exercise of his functions. The president has thus been made a formal or constitutional head of the executive and the real executive powers are vested in the Ministers or the Cabinet. The same provisions obtain in regard to the Government of States; the Governor or the Rajpramukh, as the case may be, occupies the position of the head of the executive in the State but it is virtually the council of Ministers in each State that carries on the executive Government. In the Indian Constitution, therefore, we have the same system of parliamentary executive as in England and the council of Ministers consisting, as it does, of the members of the legislature is, like the British Cabinet, \"a hyphen which joins, a buckle which fastens the legislative part of the State to the executive part.\" The Cabinet enjoying, as it does, a majority in the legislature concentrates in itself the virtual control of both legislative and executive functions; and as the Ministers constituting the Cabinet are presumably agreed on fundamentals and act on the principle of collective responsibility, the most important questions of policy are all formulated by them.  \n 17. Suppose now that the Ministry or the executive Government of a State formulates a particular policy in furtherance of which they want to start trade or business. Is it necessary that there must be a specific legislation legalising such trade activities before they could be embarked upon ? We cannot say that such legislation is always necessary. If the trade or business involves expenditure of funds, it is certainly required that Parliament should authorise such expenditure either directly or under the provisions of a statute. What is generally done in such cases is, that the sums required for carrying on the business are entered in the annual financial statement which the Ministry has to lay before the House or Houses of Legislature in respect of every financial year under article 202 of the Constitution. So much of the estimates as relate to expenditure other than those charged on the consolidated fund are submitted in the form of demands for grants to the legislature and the legislature has the power to assent or refuse to assent to any such demand or assent to a demand subject to reduction of the amount (article 203). After the grant is sanctioned, an Appropriation Bill is introduced to provide for the appropriation out of the consolidated fund of the State of all moneys required to meet the grants thus made by the Assembly (article 204). As soon as the Appropriation Act is passed, the expenditure made under the heads covered by it would be deemed to be properly authorised by law under article 266(3) of the Constitution.  \n 18. It may be, as Mr. Pathak contends, that the Appropriation Acts are no substitute for specific legislation and that they validate only the expenses out of the consolidated funds for the particular years for which they are passed; but nothing more than that may be necessary for carrying on of the trade or business. Under article 266(3) of the Constitution no moneys out of the consolidated funds of India or the consolidated fund of a State shall be appropriated except in accordance with law and for the purposes and in the manner provided in this Constitution. The expression \"law\" here obviously includes the Appropriation Acts. It is true that the Appropriation Acts cannot be said to give a direct legislative sanction to the trade activities themselves. But so long as the trade activities are carried on in pursuance of the policy which the executive Government has formulated with the tacit support of the majority in the legislature, no objection on the score of their not being sanctioned by specific legislative provision can possibly be raised. Objections could be raised only in regard to the expenditure of public funds for carrying on of the trade or business and to these the Appropriation Acts would afford complete answer.  \n 19. Specific legislation may indeed be necessary if the Government require certain powers in addition to what they possess under ordinary law in order to carry on the particular trade or business. Thus when it is necessary to encroach upon private rights in order to enable the Government to carry on their business, a specific legislation sanctioning such course would have to be passed.  \n 20. In the present case it is not disputed that the entire expenses necessary for carrying on the business of printing and publishing the text books for recognised schools in Punjab were estimated and shown in the annual financial statement and that the demands for grants, which were made under different heads, were sanctioned by the State Legislature and due Appropriation Acts were passed. For the purpose of carrying on the business the Government do not require any additional powers and whatever is necessary for their purpose, they can have by entering into contracts with authors and other people. This power of contract is expressly vested in the Government under article 298 of the Constitution. In these circumstances, we are unable to agree with Mr. Pathak that the carrying on of the business of printing and publishing text books was beyond the competence of the executive Government without a specific legislation sanctioning such course.  \n 21. These discussions however are to some extent academic and are not sufficient by themselves to dispose of the petitioners' case. As we have said already, the executive Government are bound to conform not only to the law of the land but also to the provisions of the Constitution. The Indian Constitution is a written Constitution and even the legislature cannot override the fundamental rights guaranteed by it to the citizens. Consequently, even if the acts of the executive are deemed to be sanctioned by the legislature, yet they can be declared to be void and inoperative if they infringe any of the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. On the other hand, even if the acts of the executive are illegal in the sense that they are not warranted by law, but no fundamental rights of the petitioners have been infringed thereby, the latter would obviously have no right to complain under article 32 of the Constitution though they may have remedies elsewhere if other heads of rights are infringed. The material question for consideration therefore is : What fundamental rights of the petitioners, if any, have been violated by the notifications and acts of the executive Government of Punjab undertaken by them in furtherance of their policy of nationalisation of the text books for the school students ?  \n 22. The petitioners claim fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution which guarantees, inter alia, to all persons the right to carry on any trade or business. The business which the petitioners have been carrying on is that of printing and publishing books for sale including text books used in the primary and middle classes of the schools in Punjab. Ordinarily it is for the school authorities to prescribe the text books that are to be used by the students and if these text books are available in the market the pupils can purchase them from any book-seller they like. There is no fundamental right in the publishers that any of the books printed and published by them should be prescribed as text books by the school authorities or if they are once accepted as text books they cannot be stopped or discontinued in future. With regard to the schools which are recognised by the Government the position of the publishers is still worse. The recognised schools receive aids of various kinds from the Government including grants for the maintenance of the institutions, for equipments, furniture, scholarships and other things and the pupils of the recognised schools are admitted to the school final examinations at lower rates of fees than those demanded from the students of non-recognised schools. Under the school code, one of the main conditions upon which recognition is granted by Government is that the school authorities must use as text books only those which are prescribed or authorised by the Government. So far therefore as the recognised schools are concerned and we are concerned only with these schools in the present case the choice of text books rests entirely with the Government and it is for the Government to decide in which way the selection of these text books is to be made. The procedure hitherto followed was that the Government used to invite publishers and authors to submit their books for examination and approval by the Education Department and after selection was made by the Government, the size, contents as well as the prices of the books were fixed and it was left to the publishers or authors to print and publish them and offer them for sale to the pupils. So long as this system was in vogue the only right which publishers, like the petitioners had, was to offer their books for inspection and approval by the Government. They had no right to insist on any of their books being accepted as text books. So the utmost that could be said is that there was merely a chance or prospect of any or some of their books being approved as text books by the Government. Such chances are incidental to all trades and business and there is no fundamental right guaranteeing them. A trader might be lucky in the securing a particular market for his goods but if he looses that field because the particular customers for some reason or other do not choose to buy goods from him, it is not open to him to say that it was his fundamental right to have his old customers for ever. On the one hand, therefore, there was nothing but a chance or prospect which the publishers had of having their books approved by the Government, on the other hand the Government had the undisputed right to adopt any method of selection they liked and if they ultimately decided that after approving the text books they would purchase the copyright in them from the authors and others provided the latter were willing to transfer the same to the Government on certain terms, we fail to see what right of the publishers to carry on their trade or business is affected by it. Nobody is taking away the publishers' right to print and publish any books they like and to offer them for sale but if they have no right that their books should be approved as text books by the Government it is immaterial so far as they are concerned whether the Government approves of text books submitted by other persons who are willing to sell their copyrights in the books to them, or choose to engage authors for the purpose of preparing the text books which they take up on themselves to print and publish. We are unable to appreciate the argument of Mr. Pathak that the Government while exercising their undoubted right of approval cannot attach to it a condition which has no bearing on the purpose for which the approval is made. We fail to see how the petitioners' position is in any way improved thereby. The action of the Government may be good or bad. It may be criticised and condemned in the Houses of the Legislature or outside but this does not amount to an infraction of the fundamental right guaranteed by article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.  \n23. As in our view the petitioners have no fundamental right in the present case which can be said to have been infringed by the action of the Government, the petition is bound to fail on that ground. This being the position, the other two points raised by Mr. Pathak do not require consideration at all. As the petitioners have no fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, the question whether the Government could establish a monopoly without any legislation under article 19(6) of the Constitution is altogether immaterial. Again a mere chance or prospect of having particular customers cannot be said to be a right to property or to any interest in an undertaking within the meaning of article 31(2) of the Constitution and no question of payment of compensation can arise because the petitioners have been deprived of the same. The result is that the petition is dismissed with costs.  \n PETITIONS NOS. 71 TO 77 AND 85 OF 1955.  \n Mukherjea, C.J. \n 24. These 8 petitions under article 32 of the Constitution raise identically the same points for consideration as are involved in Petition No. 652 of 1954 just disposed of. The petitioners in these cases also purport to be printers, publishers and sellers of text-books for various classes in the schools of Punjab and they complain of infraction of their fundamental rights under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution by reason of the various notifications issued by the State of Punjab in pursuance of their policy of nationalisation of text books. The learned counsel appearing in these cases have adopted in their entirely the arguments that have been advanced by Mr. Pathak in Petition No. 652 of 1954 and no fresh or additional argument has been put forward by any one of them. This being the position the decision in Petition No. 652 of 1954 will govern these petitions also and they will stand dismissed but we would make no order as to costs.  \n"}, {"id": "1126538", "date": "4/1955", "tagline": "M.

They contended inter alia that the Rajpramukh had\t no\n       competence to enact the law, that the Bill was not  prepared\n       by  the\tRajpramakh  as\trequired  by  Art.  212-A(2),  that\n       resumption  was\tnot  one  of  the  topics  of\tlegislation\n       enumerated  either  in the State List or in  the\t Concurrent\n       List  in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution  and  that\n       the  Act was therefore ultra vires the powers of the  State,\n       that  the Act did not provide for adequate compensation\tnor\n       was there any public purpose involved in it and therefore it\n       contravened  Art. 31(2), and that as the Act  was  discrimi-\n       natory  it  contravened Art. 14.\t There\twere  some  special\n       contentions that the Act was not saved by Art. 31-A, because\n       the lands resumed were neither estates nor jagirs nor grants\n       similar\tto  jagirs,  inams or muafi and that  some  of\tthe\n       properties  sought to be resumed were not jagirs as  defined\n       in  the Act and therefore the notifications under s.  21\t of\n       the Act in so far as they related to them were illegal.\n       39\n       304\n       Held that, (1) the Rajpramukh was competent to enact the im-\n       pugned  law,  under  Art.  385,\tas  he\twas  the  authority\n       functioning  immediately\t before\t the  commencement  of\tthe\n       Constitution  as the legislature of Rajasthan under art.\t  X\n       (3)  of the Covenant of the United State of Rajasthan.\tThe\n       expression  \"Ordinance\" in art.\tX (3) must be construed\t as\n       meaning\t\"Law\".\t Article  VII  (3)  of\tthe  Covenant\thas\n       reference  to  the executive power which the Rulers  had\t to\n       resume  jagirs and does not operate as a restriction on\tthe\n       legislative  powers under art.  X (3).  The  Legislature\t of\n       the corresponding State mentioned in Art. 385 refers not\t to\n       the  legislature under the Constitution, but to the body\t or\n       the  authority which was functioning as the  legislature\t of\n       the  State before the commencement of the  Constitution\tand\n       under  Art.   X (3) of the Covenant of the United  State\t of\n       Rajasthan, that authority was the Rajpramukh.\n       Article 385 does not require that that authority should have\n       had absolute and unlimited powers of legislation.  If it was\n       functioning   as\t the  legislative  authority   before\tthe\n       Constitution,  it  would, under the article,  have  all\tthe\n       powers conferred by the Constitution on the House or  Houses\n       of legislature of the States.\n       (ii) Article  212-A(2)  which provides that  the\t Rajpramukh\n       should  prepare\tthe Bill, does not require that\t he  should\n       himself draft it.  It is sufficient if he decides  questions\n       of  policy which are of the essence of the legislation.\t It\n       is  open to the Rajpramukh to adopt a Bill prepared  by\this\n       ministers  and  the only matter that will have  to  be  con-\n       sidered is whether in fact he did so.  There is no provision\n       in Art. 212-A(2) for the Rajpramukh approving of a Bill\tand\n       an  endorsement\tof  approval on the Bill  prepared  in\tthe\n       ministerial  department must therefore signify its  adoption\n       by  him.\t When the Bill is produced with an  endorsement\t of\n       approval\t under his signature, the question must be held\t to\n       be   concluded\tand  any  further  discussion\tabout\tthe\n       legislative  or\texecutive state of mind of  the\t Rajpramukh\n       must be ruled out as inadmissible.\n       (iii)\t The impugned Act is not ultra vires the powers\t of\n       the   State  Legislature\t as  the  subject-matter  of   the-\n       legislation  is\tin  substance  acquisition  of\t properties\n       falling\tunder entry 36 of List II of the Seventh  Schedule.\n       Resumption  and acquisition connote two different  concepts,\n       but  whether  the  impugned Act is one  for  acquisition\t of\n       jagirs or for their resumption must be determined with  ref-\n       erence  to  the pith and substance of the  legislation,\tthe\n       name  given to it by the legislature not being  decisive\t of\n       the  matter.  The resumption for which the Act  provides\t is\n       not  in\tenforcement of the rights which the Rulers  had\t to\n       resume  jagirs in accordance with the terms of the grant\t or\n       the  law applicable to it, but in exercise of the  sovereign\n       rights of eminent domain possessed by the State.\t Under\tthe\n       circumstances, the taking of the properties is in  substance\n       acquisition   notwithstanding   that  it\t is   labelled\t as\n       resumption.\n       The  payment of compensation to the Jagirdars is\t consistent\n       only with the taking being an acquisition and not resumption\n       in\n\t\t\t\t   305\n       accordance with the terms of the grant or the law applicable\n       to it.  Though the legislation also falls under entry 18\t of\n       List  II\t of the Seventh Schedule, there being an  entry\t 36\n       dealing with acquisition, it must be held that the Act falls\n       under that entry and is valid.\n       (iv) The\t word  'jagir' connoted originally grants  made\t by\n       Rajput  Rulers  to  their  clansmen  for\t military  services\n       rendered\t or  to\t be rendered.  Later  on  grants  made\tfor\n       religious  and charitable purposes and even  to\tnon-Rajputs\n       were  called  jagirs,  and both in  its\tpopular\t sense\tand\n       legislative  practice,  the word jagir came to  be  used\t as\n       connoting all grants which conferred on the grantees  rights\n       in  respect of land revenue, and that is the sense in  which\n       the word jagir should be construed in Art. 31-A.\n       The  object of Art. 31-A was to save legislation\t which\twas\n       directed\t to  the  abolition  of\t intermediaries\t so  as\t to\n       establish  direct  relationship between the  State  and\tthe\n       tillers\tof  the soil.  Construing the word  in\tthat  sense\n       which would achieve that object in full measure, it must\t be\n       held  that jagir was meant to cover all grants  under  which\n       the grantees had only rights in respect of revenue and  were\n       not  tillers of the soil.  Maintenance grants in\t favour\t of\n       persons\twho  were not cultivators such as  members  of\tthe\n       ruling family would be jagirs for purposes of Art. 31-A.\n       (v)  Bhomicharas.   The Bhomicharas are the  representatives\n       of Rajput Rulers who conquered the. country and\testablished\n       their sovereignty over it in the thirteenth century.   Later\n       on  the\tRuler of Jodhpur imposed his sovereignty  over\tthe\n       territory  but permitted the previous rulers to continue\t in\n       possession  of the lands on payment of an annual\t sum.\tThe\n       question was whether they held the lands as jagirs.\n       Held that, there could be a jagir only by grant by the  Rul-\n       ing  power  but that such a grant need not be  express,\tand\n       could  be implied and when the Ruler of Jodhpur imposed\this\n       sovereignty  over  the  territory  of  the  Bhomicharas\tbut\n       recognised their possession of the lands, it is as if  there\n       was annexation by him and re-grant to them of these lands.\n       Vajesinghji Joravar Singji and Others v. Secretary of  State\n       [(1924)\tL.R. 51 I.A. 357] and Secretary of State v.  Sardar\n       Bustam Khan [(1941) L.R. 68 I.A. 109], referred to.\n       Though  the Bhomicharas enjoyed large powers,  their  status\n       was  only that of subjects.  The status of a person must\t be\n       either  that  of\t a sovereign or a  subject.   There  is\t no\n       tertium\tquid.  The law does not recognise  an  intermediate\n       status  of  a person being partly a sovereign and  partly  a\n       subject.\t And when once it is admitted that the\tBhomicharas\n       had  acknowledged the sovereignty of Jodhpur,  their  status\n       can only be that of a subject.\n       Even  if the Bhomicharas did not prior to the  enactment\t of\n       the  Marwar  Land Revenue Act XL of 1949 hold the  lands\t as\n       grantees\n       306\n       from  the  State, they must be deemed to\t have  become  such\n       grantees\t by force of s. 169 of the Act which provides  that\n       all  lands  in  the  State vest in  the\tMaharajah  and\tall\n       proprietary interests therein are deemed to be held under  a\n       grant  from  him.   The Bbomicharas bad by  long\t usage\tand\n       recognition  and\t by the legislative practice of\t the  State\n       come  to\t be recognised as jagirdars and their tenure  is  a\n       jagir within the intendment of s. 169.\n       For  the purposes of Art. 31-A, it would make no\t difference\n       whether\tthe grant is made by the sovereign in the  exercise\n       of  his\tprerogative  right or by  the  legislature  in\tthe\n       exercise\t of  its  sovereign rights, Grants  which  are\tthe\n       creatures of statutes called legislative grants are  equally\n       within the operation of that article.\n       Bhomicharas  are, accordingly, within the operation of  Art.\n       31-A.\n       (vi) The position of Bhumias in Mewar is similar to that\t of\n       Bhomicharas in Marwar and in addition it was a condition\t of\n       the  terms on which their title to the lands was\t recognised\n       by  the\trulers of Chittoor and Udaipur, that  they  had\t to\n       render  military service when called upon and also pay  quit\n       rent.   Their  title  to the lands therefore  rested  on\t an\n       implied\tgrant and their tenure would be jagir even  in\tits\n       stricter sense.\n       Section\t27  of the Mewar Government Kanoon Mal\tAct  (V\t of\n       1947) enacts that all lands belong to His Highness and  that\n       no  person  has authority to take possession  of\t any  lands\n       unless  the right is granted by His Highness.   Section\t106\n       (1) of the Act declares that a Tikanadar, Jagirdar, Muafidar\n       or  Bhumia shall have all such revenue rights in\t the  lands\n       comprised  in his jagir, muafi, or Bhom under this  Act,\t as\n       are  granted to him by His Highness\".  The effect  of  these\n       provisions  was\tto impress on the Bhom tenure  the  charac-\n       teristics of a grant.\n       Article 13, Clause (1) of the Constitution of Mewar provided\n       that,  \"no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty\t or\n       property without due process of law, nor shall any person be\n       denied  equality\t before the law within the  territories\t of\n       Mewar\".\t It  was  contended for the  petitioners  that\tthe\n       impugned Act was void as contravening the above\tprovisions.\n       Held  that, as the authority which enacted the  Constitution\n       of Mewar was His Highness, it could be repealed or  modified\n       by the same authority, and the impugned Act must be held\t to\n       have repealed the Constitution to the extent that it was in-\n       consistent with it.\n       (vii)\t The Tikanadars of Shekwati got into possession\t of\n       lands as ijaradars or lessees and were subsequently  treated\n       as  jagirdars.\tTheir tenure was, if not jagirs,  at  least\n       other \"similar grants\" within Art. 31-A.\t It is included\t in\n       Schedule I to the impugned Act as item 6.\n       The  nature  of\tthe tenures of lands  held  by\tSubeguzars,\n       Mansubdars,  maintenance holders (Lawazma and  Kothrikarch),\n       Tikanadars   and\t  of  Naqdirazan,  Sansan   grants,   etc.,\n       considered,\n\t\t\t\t   307\n       (viii)\t The  Khandela\testate\twas granted in\t1836  on  a\n       permanent  lease.   The\tdefinition  of\tjagir  in  s.  2(h)\n       includes the tenures mentioned in Schedule I to the Act\tand\n       Istimrari tenure is item 2 therein. The question was whether\n       the Istimrar-ijara was within item 2.\n       Held  that, the essential features of Istimrari\ttenure\tare\n       that the lands are assessed to a nominal quit rent, and that\n       it  is  permanent.   The\t amount\t of  Rs.  80,001  fixed\t as\n       assessment  under  the  deed of 1836 cannot be  said  to\t be\n       nominal.\t The grant is, therefore, not an Istimrari  tenure,\n       but a permanent Izara.\n       (ix) Objections raised as to the validity of the Act on\tthe\n       ground that it did not provide for payment of  compensation,\n       that there was no public purpose involved in the\t resumption\n       and  that  therefore it contravenes Art. 31(2) or  that\tthe\n       provisions  of  the Act offend Art. 14, are  barred  by\tthe\n       provisions of Art. 31-A of the Constitution.\n       Even apart from Art. 31-A, the impugned Act must be held\t to\n       be  supported by public purpose and is not in  contravention\n       of Art. 31(2).  Nor is there a contravention of Art. 14,\t as\n       under the Act all jagirs are liable to be resumed, no  power\n       having been conferred on the Government to grant exemption.\n       State  of  Bihar v.

Assuming but not deciding that in dealing  with\n       an  appeal under s. 76 of the Act from the decisions of\tthe\n       Registrar  under\t s.  13 of the Act the High  Court  is\tnot\n       fettered\t by reason of the Registrar, on the hearing  before\n       him, having exercised his discretion and the High Court\tmay\n       exercise\t its  own  discretion,\tjust as\t it  could  if\tthe\n       proceedings  had been taken initially before it, it must\t be\n       remembered  that\t it is the Registrar to whom in\t the  first\n       instance\t is  committed the discretionary  power.   If  that\n       authority has exercised his discretion in good faith and not\n       in  violation of any law such exercise of discretion  should\n       not  be\tinterfered  with by the High Court  merely  on\tthe\n       ground that, in the opinion of the High Court it could  have\n       been exercised differently or even that the High Court would\n       have  exercised it differently, bad the matter been  brought\n       before  it  in the first instance.  The proper  approach\t in\n       such  a case is for the High Court to consider  whether\tthe\n       Registrar  has really gone so wrong as to make it  necessary\n       to interfere with his discretion.\n       The real purpose of requiring a disclaimer is to define\tthe\n       rights  of  the\tproprietor  under  registration\t so  as\t to\n       minimise,   even\t  if  it  cannot  wholly   eliminate,\tthe\n       possibility  of\textravagant and unauthorised  claims  being\n       made on the score of registration of the trade marks.\n       The  proviso to s. 13 preserves intact any right\t which\tthe\n       pro-.  prietor  may otherwise under any other  law  have\t in\n       relation to the mark or any part thereof.  The disclaimer is\n       only  for the purposes of the Act.  It does not\taffect\tthe\n       rights  of  the\tproprietor except such\t-as  arise  out\t of\n       registration.  That is to say, the special advantages  which\n       the  Act\t gives to the proprietor by reason  of\tthe  regis-\n       tration\tof  his trade mark do not extend to  the  parts\t or\n       matters which he disclaims.\n       Held, that considering all the circumstances of the  present\n       case  the  Registrar  had not gone so wrong as  to  make\t it\n       necessary   for\tthe  High  Court  to  interfere\t with\this\n       discretion.   If\t it  were to be regarded  as  a\t matter\t of\n       exercise\t of  discretion by the High Court as to\t whether  a\n       disclaimer should be imposed or not, it is quite clear  that\n       the  attention  of  the\tHigh Court  was\t not  drawn  to\t an\n       important  consideration, namely, the strong possibility\t of\n       the  respondent\tcompany claiming a statutory right  to\tthe\n       word 'Shree' by virtue of the registration of its trade mark\n       and  subject  others  to infringement actions  only  on\tthe\n       strength\t of  the registration and without  proof  of  facts\n       which  it  would\t have otherwise to establish  in  order\t to\n       succeed\tin a passing off action or a prosecution under\tthe\n       Indian  Penal Code and, therefore, the High Court cannot\t be\n       said to have properly exercised its discretion,\n       254\n       Sharp v.

The plaintiffs, resident in  Lyallpur,\nwere the government nominees, The\n403\ndefendant  company,  with  its head office at  Delhi  had  a\nbranch\toffice\tand  mills at  Lyallpur,  and  supplied\t the\nplaintiffs  with cloth from time to time in accordance\twith\nthe government quota through its branch manager at Lyallpur.\nTheir dealings lasted some 4 or 5 years prior to 1947.\nIn  accordance\twith their contract the\t plaintiffs  left  a\nsecurity  deposit of Rs. 1,000 with the\t defendant's  branch\nmanager\t at  Lyallpur, and deposited further sums  of  money\nwith  him  from\t time to time at  Lyallpur.   The  defendant\nsupplied  the plaintiffs with their quota of  cloth  against\nthose  deposits.  There was thus a running  account  between\nthe  parties  in  which the balance  was  sometimes  in\t the\nplaintiffs' favour and sometimes against them; when against,\nthey  paid the defendant interest on the  \"overdraft\".\t The\ngoods  had  to be supplied at Lyallpur and all\tmoneys\twere\npaid  there.   The  accounts were kept\tat  Lyallpur  though\ncopies were sent to the defendant's head office at Delhi.\nIn  1947, when India was partitioned, Lyallpur was  assigned\nto Pakistan.  The plaintiffs thereupon fled the country\t and\nentered India as refugees.  They settled in -Delhi and\tthus\nbecame\t\"evacuees\"  according to a Pakistan  ordinance.\t  At\nthat  time  there  was a balance of Rs.\t 11,496-6-6  in\t the\nplaintiffs' favour.  They accordingly made a demand at Delhi\nfor  payment  of this sum and for return of  their  security\ndeposit.\nIn the meanwhile the Pakistan Government issued an ordinance\n(1) vesting all evacuee property in the Custodian of Evacuee\nProperty  in Pakistan (2) prohibiting the 'payment of  money\nto  evacuees;  and (3) requiring all moneys payable  to,  or\nclaimable by, evacuees to be paid to the Deputy Custodian of\nEvacuee\t Property  in Pakistan.\t Payments so  made  were  to\noperate as a discharge from further liability to the  extent\nof  the\t payment.  Breach of this law was punishable  as  an\noffence.\nThe Deputy Custodian demanded payment from the defendant  of\nthe   moneys   owing   to   the\t  plaintiff.\tAfter\tsome\ncorrespondence and demur, the payment was made as  required.\nThe defendant pleaded this as a defence to the action.\nHeld:\t  (1)  Lyallpur was the place of primary  obligation\nbecause\t under\tthe contract the balance  remaining  at\t its\ntermination  was  to  be  paid\tthere  and  not\t  elsewhere,\naccordingly  the demand for payment made at Delhi  before  a\ndemand and refusal at Lyallpur was ineffective;\n(2)  That  the\telements out of which the  contract  to\t pay\narose were most densely grouped at Lyallpur, so Lyallpur was\nthe natural seat of the contract and the place with which it\nhad its closest and most real connection.  Accordingly,\t the\n\"proper law of the contract\" was the Lyallpur Law;\n(3)  Under  the English doctrine also the situs of the\tdebt\nwas Lyallpur; and so\n404\n(4)  either way, the Lyallpur law applied\n(5)  as it obtained at Lyallpur at the time when performance\n was  due  because a \" proper law\" intended as\ta  whole  to\ngovern a contract is administered as a \"living and  changing\nbody  of law\", accordingly, effect is given to\tany  changes\noccurring in it before performance is due;\n(6)  a\t\"debt\" being a chose in action is \"property\"  within\nthe meaning of the Pakistan Ordinance and so,\n(7)  the money was rightly paid to the Deputy Custodian\t and\nthat  operated\tas  a  good  discharge\tand  exonerated\t the\ndefendant from further liability.\nBut quaere, whether different conditions would not arise  in\na  case\t where no payment is made and the defendant  has  no\ngarnishable assets in Pakistan out of which the West  Punjab\nGovernment  could  realise the debt out of  the\t defendant's\nproperty there.\n(8)The provisions of the Pakistan ordinance relevant to the\ncase  are not opposed to the public policy of India  and  so\ncan be relied on as a defence to an action of this nature.\n Appeal allowed.\nMount  Albert  Borough Council v.

This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order of a single Judge of the Allahabad High Court confirming those of the Sessions Judge of Azamgarh so far as the appellants were concerned, convicting them under Section 395, I.P.C., and sentencing them to rigorous imprisonment for seven years each.\nThe three appellants along with three others including Bhirgu Singh were placed on trial for dacoity before the learned Sessions Judge of Azamgarh who convicted and sentenced all of them as aforesaid. On appeal to the Allahabad High Court, the learned Judge acquitted three of them but maintained the conviction and sentence of the three appellants.\n2. The occurrence of dacoity which was the subject matter of the charge against the appellants and others, is said to have taken place at the house of one Kalapnath Singh (P.W. 1), whom we shall call the complainant. He sent a written report to the police station at Mohammadabad, sub-district Ghosi, through the village chowkidar (P.W. 8). That report was treated as the first information (Ex. P-6) dated 4-6-1951 at 3-15 A.M. The police station is about four miles from village Dangauli, where the occurrence is Said to have taken place.\nThe report is to the effect that between 1 and 2 A.M., when the complainant, his brother-in-law (P.W. 2) and his servant Baljore (P.W. 4) were sleeping on separate cots in the open courtyard in front of the residential house, they were awakened by the intrusion of 14 or 15 persons armed with lathis and spears. Some of the dacoits beat the complainant, some of them kept watch on the three (persons aforesaid and the others got the entrance opened by one of the female inmates of the house, Mt. Pyari (P.W. 11), the complainant's sister-in-law.\nSome of the dacoits entered the premises and removed boxes containing ornaments and clothes. The dacoits are also said to have snatched away some ornaments from the neck of the complainant's wife, Mt. Saraswati (P.W. 12). On an alarm being raised by P.W 11, Surajbali Singh (P.W. 3), Balai Ahir (not examined), Chhotu Singh (P.W. 13), Ramchandra Tiwari (P.W. 6), and Jagdish Singh (P.W. 7) of the village arrived.\nSome of the dacoits also beat P.Ws. 3 and 6 aforesaid. As more people of the village arrived, the dacoits made good their escape with their booty. It was also alleged that the dacoits had been lighting electric torches in the light of which, as also of a lantern kept burning at the door, the dacoits were recognized and the appellants along with three others of the very same village of the complainant were named as the accused and articles worth Rs. 500 are said to have been looted away.\nThe three appellants belong to the neighbouring village called Alipur. The Sub-Inspector (P. W. 14) arrived at the place of occurrence at 5 A.M. When he reached the spot, the complainant gave him a list of stolen property (Ex. P-2). The Sub-Inspector inspected the locality and found things scattered here and there. He also found a lantern hanging at the door of which he took possession.\nAbout three furlongs to the west of the house of the complainant he found three boxes and some torn pieces of cloth. He took possession of them and drew up recovery lists. He sent the injured persons, namely, the complainant (P.W. 1), Suraj Ball Singh (P.W. 3) and Ramchandra Tiwari (P.W. 6) who all had simple injuries caused by a blunt weapon like a lathi. He interrogated the complainant and the other eyewitnesses, namely P.Ws. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 13 and got the statements of some of those witnesses recorded under Section 164, Criminal P. C.\nUltimately he submitted a charge-sheet as a result of which the six accused named in the first information report only were placed on their trial after the necessary commitment proceedings. The charge against the six accused persons placed on the trial was in these terms :--\n\"That you on or about the 3/4 night of June 1951 in vil. Dangauli, P.S. Mohammadabad at about midnight committed dacoity at the house of Kalapnath and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 395, I.P.C., and within the cognizance of the court of session, Azamgarh.\nAnd I hereby direct that you be tried by the court on the said charge\".\nThe defence of the accused persons as disclosed in their examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C. and in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses was that they all had been implicated falsely on account of a pre-existing enmity between the complain ant's party to which belonged the prosecution witnesses who figure as eye-witnesses to the occurrence and that of the accused Bhirghu Singh, who was one of the three convicted persons acquitted by the High Court.\nThe appellants who belong to the adjoining village Alipur, also suggested the same defence. Their case was that as they had helped Bhirghu Singh in his dispute and litigation with the party to which the complainant belongs they had also been falsely implicated.\n3. It is noteworthy that only the six persons named in the first information report were placed on their trial, though 14 to 16 persons are said to have participated in the dacoity. None of the unknown dacoits was placed on trial, apparently because none could be identified by any of the eye-witnesses during the investigation. The charge as framed does not refer to any other person besides the six accused to have been concerned with the occurrence. Besides the complainant and the inmates of his house P. Ws. 2, 4, 11 and 12, the eye-witnesses were Surajbali (P. W. 3), Ramchander (P. W. 6), Jagdish (P.W. 7) and Jagtu (P. W. 10).\n4. The trial court examined the evidence in a mechanical way and after referring to the evidence of the eye-witnesses, observed that \"There does not appear to be any reason why the testimony of these witnesses should not be believed\". Having come to that conclusion, it saw no difficulty in convicting and sentencing all the accused persons as indicated above, though significantly enough the assessors were unanimously of the opinion that none of the accused was guilty.\nIn a dacoity case it is not usual for assessors to be soft with persons accused of dacoity. The assessors, as will presently appear from the history of the previous litigation between the two parties in the village, naturally took the view that the prosecution evidence bearing on the question of the identification of the accused persons was unreliable.\n5. On appeal, the learned Judge made the following observations :\n\"It is significant that although Bhirgu Singh belongs to the same village he is not alleged to have taken any precaution to conceal his identity by means of a Dhata or any other device. This is something unnatural and improbable. Generally people do not g(c) out to commit dacoities in their own village for fear of identification.\nEven if they have a hand in getting a dacoity committed in their own village they generally hire persons for the purpose from, outside so that they may not be easily identified. They keep themselves in the background. If, for any reason, they find it-necessary to be present at the scene of dacoity they take ample precautions to cover their faces by some device.\nI find it difficult to believe that Bhirgu, Singh, who is well-known in the village and who was on bad terms with Kalapnath Singh could have gone to commit dacoity in his. own village without taking the least precaution to conceal his identity\". The learned Judge gave the benefit of those observations only to the three accused belonging to the complainant's village and not to the other three belonging to the adjoining village Alipur, and equally well known as partisans of Bhirgu aforesaid.\nIt is admitted by the complainant, as also by some of the eye-witnesses that these appellants were well known to them for the last six or seven years, so much so that even a pardanashin woman like P.W. 11 claims to have known the first appellant Ramshankar, from before the occurrence, though it would be difficult to believe that statement in view of the following admission made by her in cross-examination:--\n\"Prior to dacoity I did not know any man of Alipur. After the dacoity nobody gave me name of anyone of Alipur. During the dacoity nobody told me name of anyone of Alipur\".\nThat these appellants were well known to the eye-witnesses who deposed against them will be clear from the following facts as they emerge as a result of the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. All the Thakurs of the village of occurrence are descendants of a common ancestor and all the Thakurs witnesses,--and they are the majority of the prosecution witnesses of identification, -- are naturally agnatic relations. So was Bhirgu, the principal accused in the group from that village itself. Bhirgu and Lalta are brothers. This Lalta was said to have been adopted by Harbans Singh who had no son.\nNaturally, the other agnatic relations of Harbans, namely Surajbali (P.W. 3), Jagdish (P.W. 7) and Chhotu (P.W. 13), who were said to be the first to turn up at the alarm of the dacoity raised by one of the inmates of the house as aforesaid, were not inclined to recognize the adoption and the legal consequences of the adoption, namely, that Harbans's property should go to Lalta.\nThis led to a collision between the party of Lalta's brother Bhirgu and the party to which the complainant belongs, namely, P.Ws. 3, 7, and 13. This resulted in a criminal case of assault in which Bhirgu figured as the complainant with certain injuries on the head and the prosecution witnesses aforesaid as the accused. Bhirgu had admitted in his statement under Section 342, Criminal P. C. as follows : . .\n\"Harbans had no issue. He adopted my brother Lalta Singh. He had a field. After adoption Chhotu, Surajbali, Jagdish and others wanted to take possession of that field. Marpit took place in respect of that field between myself, other members of my family on the one hand and Chhotu, Surajbali and Jagdish on the other.\nGalpu Singh also took part in that mar-pit on behalf of Chhotu, etc. I received injuries at my head during that marpit. My hand bone was also fractured. Kalpu had also received injuries at his head during that marpit. He had received good many other injuries as well. I lodged a complaint under Section 323, I.P.C. but I left out Kalpu because he had. received good many injuries. This happened two months prior to dacoity. Because of this and because of other litigations I have been falsely implicated\".\n6. This defence was taken before the Committing Court also and the prosecution witnesses like the complainant and P.Ws. 3, 6, 7 and 13 had been specifically questioned and though they admitted those litigations before the Committing Magistrate, at the trial they either took shelter behind a failing memory or told a brazenfaced lie by denying that they had made such statements. For example, P.W. 1 was questioned in cross-examination and answered as follows:--\n\"Q: You stated before the Committing Magistrate:--\n\"After adoption a litigation took place between Bhirgu Singh and Surajbali, Chhotu and Jagdish P.Ws.?\"\nA: I do not remember\". Similarly Surajbali (P.W. 3) gave   the  same answer to the following question  in  cross-examination:--\n\"Q: You stated there (Committing Magistrate):\n'I had litigation with Bhirgu Singh. In that case Chhotu's brother Ram Adhar and Rikhdeo father of Jagdish witness were also with me.  A criminal case had  also been faught out'?\nA: I do not remember\".\nThe witness was cornered in cross-examination after he had the audacity to deny in the earlier part of his cross-examination that he had any litigation with Bhirgu about the property of Harbans Singh. P.W. 7 was also severely cross-examined and questions about enmity and his previous statements before the Committing Magistrate to a similar effect were put to him and he had the audacity to deny having made such a statement previously.\nThough he denied knowledge of Harbans having adopted Lalta, he admitted that a case was fought between Harbans and Bhirgu on the one side and his father, P.W. Chhotu's brother and Surajbali on the other. He also admitted that in respect of Harban's land, a case under Section 145, Criminal P. C. was also fought between the same parties.\nThat case started prior to the dacoity and terminated after the occurrence. Though at first he was inclined not to admit that there was a criminal prosecution also in respect of those very lands, he ultimately admitted that Bhirgu had brought a criminal case in which he (the witness) also was an accused in respect of the occurrence in which the complainant had received injuries on his-head. The witness has further admitted that the members of the family of P.Ws. Surajbali and Chhotu arid the members of his family, as also Ram Adhar brother of Chhotu figured as accused persons in that criminal prosecution.\n7. There is thus ample evidence on the record as found by the High Court also, that there was litigation in respect of the property of Harbans between the party led by Bhirgu, brother of Lalta who was adopted by Harbans on the one side and the prominent prosecution witnesses in this case on the other. The litigation first began before the Tahsildar, presumably on the revenue side. Then there was a criminal prosecution of those prosecution witnesses in the case of assault brought by Bhorgu and ultimately there were proceedings under Section 145, Criminal P. C. by the magistrate for keeping the peace between the two contending parties. Those proceedings terminated after the occurrence in question.\n8. So far as Ramshankar the first appellant is concerned, there is the further suggestion of enmity between him and Rambaz Singh admittedly the maternal uncle's son of P.W. 2. The witness denied any such enmity but P.W. 4 Ramchander has admitted that there was such enmity. It was suggested to the complainant in cross-examination that Ramshankar, and other accused were more substantial people of a higher social status than he. But he stoutly denied that. He had also denied that Ramshankar had a brick-built house, was a zamindar and had cultivation of three ploughs.\nBut P.W. 4 has in his cross-examination admitted that as a matter of fact Ramshankar has a house made of bricks, that he has some zamindari and has cultivation of three ploughs. He also admitted that Bhirgu and Ramshankar were men of higher status than the complainant. The most damaging admission made by this witness, so far as the prosecution case is concerned, is that the appellants \"had always helped Bhorgu in getting possession of the fields\", referring to the dispute between Bhorgu as representing his brother's cause as against the prosecution witnesses aforesaid.\n9. The High Court was perfectly justified in brushing aside the evidence of the prosecution witnesses who apparently were not truthful witnesses, besides being very inimically disposed against the accused. The case against the three accused persons belonging to the same village did not fail for paucity of evidence of identification, but because the considerable body of evidence was tainted testimony.\nBut the High Court appears to have erred in making a distinction between the case of those three accused and of the appellants living in the adjoining village Alipur. In my opinion, the High Court did not give sufficient weight to the evidence elicited in cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses showing that all the six accused persons belonged to the party actively opposed to the party of the complainant and that they had good reasons for trying to utilize a true case of dacoity by falsely implicating their enemies.\nIn my opinion, there are no sufficient reasons for differentiating, the case of the appellants from that of the other accused who were acquitted by the High Court. And these considerations, however, arise on the factual aspect of the case. This Court on special leave does not ordinarily interfere with findings of fact of the courts below. But fortunately for the appellants, a clear question of law has been raised on the findings arrived at by the High Court.\n10. The charge framed against the six persons placed on trial did not indicate that those six persons along with other unknown persons had committed dacoity. The charge was that the six persons placed on trial were the persons who had committed dacoity.\nOn the findings arrived at by the High Court resulting in the acquittal of three out of the six persons jointly tried, we are left only with the three appellants as the persons concerned with the crime. It is possible to direct a retrial on a proper charge being framed so as to give sufficient notice to the accused persons that more than five persons were actually concerned with the alleged crime. This aspect of the matter could not have been discussed by the trial court in the view it took of the evidence.\nHaving convicted all the six persons under Section 395, I. P. C., no such question of law could arise before it. Even in the High Court this question was not mooted, apparently because the appellants were all sailing in the same boat and a common argument appears to have been advanced.\nThe High Court having come to the conclusion that three out of the six convicted persons were not guilty, should have gone into the question whether there was satisfactory evidence to show that the three remaining appellants before it could be convicted under Section 395, I. P. C., on the charge as framed. In any event, the three remaining accused persons could be convicted of the j lesser offence of robbery under Section 392, I.P.C., if there was evidence to show that they had committed acts of theft and used violence while committing the theft.\nIn such a situation their individual acts in connection with the alleged occurrence had to be considered. That also has not been done. The evidence led on behalf of the prosecution has not sought to bring home to each individual accused the part played by him. This would also necessitate a retrial. In this connection the counsel for the appellants urged, and this position was not controverted by the counsel for the prosecution, that the appellants have been in jail for a little less than three years, which period of imprisonment may have been enough as a sentence under Section 392, I. P. C.\nThese are circumstances which point to the conclusion that this is not a fit case for ordering a retrial on an amended charge. If the evidence against the appellants were above serious criticism, and that is by no means the case as already indicated, I would have had no hesitation in ordering a retrial. But having regard to the circumstances of this case, I do not think that such a course should be taken in the interests of justice. I accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and direct that the appellants be set at liberty forthwith.\nS.R. Das, J.\n11. I agree that this appeal should be allowed but I prefer to rest my decision entirely on the second point referred to by my learned brother in the judgment just delivered by him. I entirely agree with the reasons he has given for his decision on that point.\nBhagwati, J.\n12. I  agree  and there is nothing which I can usefully add.\n"}, {"id": "1004330", "date": "4/1955", "tagline": "Raj Kali Kuer vs Ram Rattan Pandey on 7 April, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nRAJ KALI KUER\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nRAM RATTAN PANDEY\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n07/04/1955\n\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\n\nCITATION:\n 1955 AIR  493\t\t  1955 SCR  (2) 186\n\n\nACT:\nHindu  Law-Hereditary priestly office of a Pujari and  Panda\n-Hindu female-Bight to succeed-Usage.\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\nThough a female is personally disqualified from\t officiating\nas  a Pujari for the Shastrically installed and\t consecrated\nidols in the temples, the usage of a Hindu female succeeding\nto a priestly office and getting the same erformed through a\ncompetent  deputy  has been well-recognised and\t it  is\t not\ncontrary to textual Hindu Law nor opposed to public  policy.\n-  Subject  to\tthe proper and efficient  discharge  of\t the\nduties of the office being safeguarded by appropriate action\nwhen necessary, a Hindu female has a right to succeed to the\nhereditary priestly office of a Pujari and Panda held by her\nhusband\t and to get the duties of the office performed by  a\nsubstitute  except in cases where usage to the\tcontrary  is\npleaded and established.\nQuaere:-Whether\t  and  how  far\t votive\t offerings  can\t  be\nappropriated by a Pujari for his emoluments if the temple is\na  public institution, (i.e., not a private  family  temple)\nand whether any usage in this behalf is valid.\nCase-law and the relevant texts reviewed.\nJudgment of the High -Court of Patna reversed.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:\n"}, {"id": "511932", "date": "4/1955", "tagline": "Rao Shiva Bahadur Singh vs The State Of Vindhya Pradesh And ... on 5 April, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nRAO SHIVA BAHADUR SINGH\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE STATE OF VINDHYA PRADESH AND ANOTHER.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n05/04/1955\n\nBENCH:\nMUKHERJEE, BIJAN KR.

A rule nisi having been issued, the respondents have filed an affidavit by way of return to the writ. The question for our decision is whether the return is good and sufficient in law.  \n 2. The facts leading up to the present petition are few and simple. In the years 1948 and 1949 the petitioner was the Minister of Industries in the Government of Vindhya Pradesh which was at that time an acceding State within the meaning of section 6 of the Government of India Act, 1935 as amended in 1947. On the 11th April, 1949 the petitioner was arrested in Delhi on the allegation that he had accepted illegal gratification in order to show favour to Panna Diamond Mining Syndicate in the matter of the lease of the Diamond Mines at Panna. In December, 1949 the petitioner along with one Mohan Lal, who was the then secretary in the Ministry of Industries, was put up for trial before the Court of Special Judge, Rewa, constituted under the Vindhya Pradesh Criminal Law Amendments (Special Courts) Ordinance No. V of 1949. The charges were under sections 120-B, 161, 465 and 466 of the Indian Penal Code as adapted for Vindhya Pradesh by the Indian Penal Code (Application to Vindhya Pradesh) Ordinance No. XLVIII of 1949. By his judgment pronounced on the 26th July, 1950 the Special Judge acquitted both the accused. The State preferred an appeal against that acquittal to the Judicial Commissioner of Vindhya Pradesh. By his judgment pronounced on the 10th March, 1951 the Judicial Commissioner reversed the order of acquittal, convicted both the accused and sentenced them to different terms of rigorous imprisonment under the different sections in addition to the payment of certain fines. On the application of the petitioner and his co-accused the Judicial Commissioner on the 12th March, 1951 issued a certificate to the effect that four points of law raised in the case and formulated by him in his order were fit for the consideration of this Court in appeal under article 134 of the Constitution of India. A petition of appeal was filed in this Court on the strength of this certificate of fitness and it was registered as Criminal Appeal No. 7 of 1951.  \n 3. As the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, it was, in April 1953, placed before a Bench of five Judges of this Court as required by article 145(3) of the Constitution. For convenience of reference we shall call a Bench of five or more Judges as the Constitution Bench. The validity of the convictions and sentences was challenged before the Constitution Bench on the ground that there had been infringements of articles 14 and 20 of the Constitution. A further point of law was raised that no appeal lay to the Judicial Commissioner from the acquittal by the Special Judge. By their judgment pronounced on the 22nd May, 1953 the Constitution Bench rejected all these objections. The judgment concluded with the following direction : \"The appeal is accordingly directed to be posted for consideration whether it is to be heard on merits.\" This was evidently done in view of the fact that the certificate of fitness granted by the Judicial Commissioner was limited only to four points of law.  \n 4. The constitutional points having been disposed of, the appeal was placed a Division Bench of three Judges who on the 20th October, 1953 ordered the appeal to be heard on the merits. The appeal was accordingly put up for hearing before another Division Bench consisting of three Judges. On the 5th March, 1954 this Division Bench allowed the appeal of Mohan Lal and acquitted him but dismissed the appeal of the petitioner with respect to his conviction under section 161, 465 and 466, Indian Penal Code, as adapted in Vindhya Pradesh, but set aside his conviction on the charge under section 120-B. The sentence of three years' rigorous imprisonment was maintained but the sentence of fine was set aside.  \n 5. On the 18th March, 1954 a petition for review was filed on behalf of the petitioner. It was directed against the judgment of the Constitution Bench pronounced on the 22nd May, 1953 repelling the constitutional points as well as against the judgment of the Division Bench dated the 5th March, 1954 dismissing the petitioner's appeal on the merits. On objection being taken by the Registry against one application being filed for the review of two judgments one of which had been pronounced much earlier than the period allowed for filing a review application, the petitioner filed a second application for review of the judgment of the Constitution Bench and prayed for condonation of the delay in filing the same. On the 5th April, 1954 the application for review was put up for hearing before the same Division Bench which had pronounced the judgment on the merits dated the 5th March, 1954. After considering the points of review relating to that judgment the Division Bench on the same day came to the conclusion that no ground had been made out for review of that judgment and accordingly dismissed the petition. An order was drawn up as of that date directing the petitioner who had been previously enlarged on bail to surrender and serve out his sentence.  \n 6. On the 12th April, 1954 another petition was filed on behalf of the petitioner praying that the review matter relating to the judgment of the Constitution Bench delivered on the 22nd May, 1953 be placed before a Constitution Bench for final disposal. That review application was put up before a Constitution Bench which on the 17th May, 1954 declined to entertain the same.  \n 7. In the meantime the petitioner had in the last week of April 1954 surrendered and has since then been confined in the Central Jail at Rewa. The present application has, therefore, been made for a writ of habeas corpus on the allegation that the petitioner has been and is being deprived of his liberty otherwise than in accordance with procedure established by law.  \n 8. In the present petition the petitioner has again urged that the Court of the Judicial Commissioner of Vindhya Pradesh was not the proper forum for entertaining the appeal against the judgment of the Special Judge and consequently the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner setting aside acquittal of the petitioner convicting and imposing sentence of imprisonment was void and inoperative. Alternatively, it has been urged that, assuming that the Judicial Commissioner had jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Special Judge and his judgment was in accordance with procedure established by law, the appeal filed by the petitioner in this Court against the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner should have been, under article 145(3) of the Constitution, heard and completely disposed of by the Constitution Bench. As regards the first point as to the incompetency of the Court of the Judicial commissioner to entertain the appeal from the decision of the Special Judge the same has been fully dealt with by the Constitution Bench and cannot be reagitated. Indeed, learned counsel appearing in support of this petition has not pressed the same. The only point urged before us is the alternative plea mentioned above which depends for its decision on a true construction of article 145.\n 9. Article 145 by clause (1) authorises this Court, subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament and with the approval of the President, to make rules for regulating generally the practice and procedure of the Court, including, amongst others, rules as to the procedure for hearing appeals, as to the entertainment of appeals under sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of article 134 and as to the conditions subject to which any judgment pronounced or order made by the Court may be reviewed and the procedure for such review. Clauses (2) and (3) of the article are in the terms following :-  \n \"(2) Subject to the provisions of clause (3), rules made under this article may fix the minimum number of Judges who are to sit for any purpose, and may provide for the powers of single Judges and Division Courts.  \n (3) The minimum number of Judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution or for the purpose of hearing any reference under article 143 shall be five :  \n Provided that, where the Court hearing an appeal under any of the provisions of this Chapter other than article 132 consists of less than five Judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the Court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal, such Court shall refer the question for opinion to a Court constituted as required by this clause for the purpose of deciding any case involving such a question and shall on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion.\"   \n 10. The contention of the petitioner is that the question whether a particular case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution is to be examined at the time when the case first comes before this Court. If at that stage it is found that it is a case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution it becomes irrevocably impressed with that character and quality and the minimum number of Judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding such case must be a Constitution Bench, that is to say, a Bench of at least five Judges. The argument then proceeds to say that once the Constitution Bench takes session of the case and starts the hearing that Bench and that Bench alone must decide the whole of such case, that is to say, decide all question, constitutional or otherwise, arising in the case. Sri Purshottam Trikumdas who appears in support of this petition has strongly relied on the language used in clause (3) and contends that \"the case\" cannot be split up and that the clause requires the entire case to be disposed of by the Constitution Bench. He, therefore, urges that the Division Bench had no jurisdiction to take up the case involving substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution and consequently the judgment of that Division Bench pronounced on the 5th March, 1954 was illegal and void. According to him, his client's appeal, in the eye of law, remains undisposed of and as he had been let out on bail until the disposal of his appeal, his detention in jail pursuant to the judgment of the Division Bench, which is a nullity, amounts to deprivation of his personal liberty otherwise than in accordance with procedure established by law and is an infringement of his fundamental right under article 21 of the Constitution. The argument at first sight certainly appears to be plausible but on a deeper consideration of the constitutional provisions bearing on the subject and the general principles regulating the procedural powers of Courts we are unable to accept the same as sound or well-founded.  \n 11. In this very case the Judicial Commissioner of Vindhya Pradesh had granted a certificate of fitness under article 134(1)(c). Consequently under the proviso to clause (3) of article 145 the appeal might well have been placed before a Division Bench consisting of less than five Judges. In that situation, being satisfied that the appeal involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution the determination of which was necessary for the disposal of the appeal, that Division Bench could refer the question for the opinion of a Constitution Bench and on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion; but to accede to the argument of Sri Purshottam Trikumdas will lead us to hold that while a Division Bench of three Judges could split up this very case, had it been posted before it in the first instance, by referring the constitutional question to a Constitution Bench for its opinion and then, after receipt of that opinion, disposing of the rest of the case on merits in conformity with such opinion, a Constitution Bench of five or more Judges before which the case happened to be posted in the first instance could not split up the case by dealing the constitutional questions and leaving the rest of the case to be dealt with and disposed of by a Division Bench of less than five Judges on merits in conformity with the opinion of the Constitution Bench thus saving the time of the Constitution Bench. Reference may also be made to article 228 which authorises the High Court, if satisfied that a case pending in a Court subordinate to it involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case, to withdraw the case and either to dispose of the case itself or determine the said question of law and return the case to the Court from which it has been so withdrawn so as to enable the said Court to proceed to dispose of the case in conformity with the judgment of the High Court. Here again learned counsel's argument leads us to hold that while the High Court can split up a case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution a Constitution Bench of this Court cannot do so. Apart from these provisions of the Constitution there are provisions made by procedural statutes which result in a case being partly heard by one Judge and partly by another Judge. To cite only a few instances, reference may be made to section 24 and Order 18, rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure and sections 350, 526, 528 and 556 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The argument of Sri Purshottam Trikumdas, pushed to its logical conclusion, must amount to this that although Court operating under the ordinary procedural code may split up cases into different stages for the purpose of hearing and decision, a Constitution Bench of this Court cannot do so if a case involving substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution happens to be posted before it in the first instance.  \n 12. Learned counsel for the petitioner recognises the incongruity that results from his argument but contends that it cannot be helped because the relevant provisions referred to above expressly sanction the splitting up of cases whereas the body of clause (3) of article 145 does not. His argument is that in the cases mentioned above splitting up of cases has to be allowed because the special provisions of the Constitution or other statutes provide for such splitting up in those cases. He contends that the very fact that these provisions had to be made clearly indicates that but for them there could not have been any splitting up of the case. It is said that these provisions are exceptions to the general rule of indivisibility of a case. We are unable to accept this reasoning as correct.  \n 13. In the first place the proviso to article 145(3), article 228 and the other provisions of the Codes referred to above quite clearly indicate that the splitting up of cases into different stages for hearing and decision is not repugnant to the Constitution or the general principles of procedural law. The underlying principle of the Constitution is clear and all that it insists upon is that all constitutional questions should be heard and decided by a Bench of not less than five Judges. As long as this requirement is fulfilled there can be no constitutional objection to the rest of the case being disposed of by a Division Bench of less than five Judges, so as to save the time of the Constitution Bench of five or more Judges.  \n 14. In the next place we are not aware of any such general rule of indivisibility as is being insisted upon by learned counsel. There is nothing in principle which requires that a case must always be decided in its entirely by one Judge or one set of Judges even though such a case may conveniently be dealt with in two or more stages. Indeed, in Maulvi Muhammad Abdul Majid v. Muhammad Abdul Aziz (L.R. 24 I.A. 22) the Privy Council pointed out that where a Judge had before him a case of consisting of two parts, a question of title and an incidental question of account depending on title, it did not require any provision of the Civil Procedure Code to authorise him to decide the first question and reserve the second for further investigation and that to treat such a proceeding as beyond the power of the Court and as an error which barred the proceedings reserved for further decision was a serious miscarriage of justice. Indeed, the Court often exercises its inherent power, if it thinks fit to do so, to decide questions of jurisdiction of limitation or the like as preliminary questions reserving other questions of fact for future investigation. The decision of a case at two or more stages may and often does result in the case not being decided by the same Judge, for the Judge who decided at the first stage may, by reason of death, retirement or transfer, be not available for deciding the case at the later stages. It follows, therefore, that no argument can be founded on any supposed general rule of indivisibility of a case for the purpose of its hearing and decision.  \n 15. The consideration that there is no such general rule as is relied on by learned counsel and that the splitting up of cases is not generally repugnant to law and in particular to Constitution, leads us to the conclusion that in construing clause (3) of article 145 no quality of indivisibility need be attributed to the words \"the case\" used therein. A case may, to begin with, involve a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, but it may cease to do so at a later stage. Suppose a case which involves a constitutional question is placed before a Constitution Bench but learned counsel appearing in support of the case intimates to the Bench that he does not press any constitutional point, surely he cannot, in that situation, insist that the time of a Bench of five or more Judges should be spent on the determination of a case which, by his own election, has ceased to involve any constitutional question. Likewise, when the constitutional questions involved in the case are disposed of by a Constitution Bench what remains of the case cannot properly or appropriately be described as still a \"case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution.\" It should be borne in mind that when a case or appeal is properly admitted to this Court all that the parties are entitled to is a decision of this Court and not of any particular Bench. So long as the minimum number of Judges which the Constitution and the rules framed by this Court prescribe are present to hear and decide the questions raised from stage to stage, they represent the Court for the purpose of giving decisions on its behalf and the parties get all that they are entitled to under the law. If a Court is entitled to decide a case in stages, as the Privy Council has held it can, there is no reason why article 145(3) should be so construed as to deprive this Court of that inherent power. It will involve no violation of any principle of natural justice or of any legal principle if we construe clause (3) of article 145 as requiring only that the minimum number of five Judges must sit for the purpose of deciding any case in so far and as long as it involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution. We find nothing in the language of clause (3) of article 145 which militates against this interpretation of that clause. Indeed, it is on this interpretation that the practice has grown up in this Court for a Constitution Bench to dispose of all constitutional questions and to leave the other subsidiary questions for disposal by a Division Bench of less than five Judges in conformity with the opinion of the Constitution Bench. There is nothing that we find in the body of clause (3) of article 145 which compels us to depart from the famous maxim cursus curiae est lex curiae which was laid down by Lord Coke in Burrowes v. High Commission Court (3 Bulst. 48, 53) and which was quoted with approval in Habibar Rahman v. Saidannessa Bibi (I.L.R. 51 Cal. 331, 335).  \n16. For reasons stated above we consider that a good and valid return has been made by the respondents to the rule nisi issued to them and this application must be dismissed. We order accordingly.  \n Sinha, J. \n 17. I regret to have to differ from any learned brethren on the construction of article 145(3) of the Constitution which is the main question in controversy in this case. Clause (3) of article 145 is in these terms :-  \n \"The minimum number of Judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution or for the purpose of hearing any reference under article 143 shall be five :  \n Provided that, where the Court hearing an appeal under any of the provisions of this Chapter other than article 132 consists of less than five Judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the Court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal, such Court shall refer the question for opinion to a Court constituted as required by this clause for the purpose of deciding any case involving such a question and shall on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion.\"   \n 18. It is noteworthy that the Constitution has not vested this Court with complete power to make rules as to the constitution of Benches for hearing matters coming before this Court in its Original, Appellate or Advisory Jurisdiction. Clause (2) of article 145 has invested this Court with power to make rules fixing the minimum number of Judges who are to sit for any purpose and for defining the powers of single Judges and Division Courts. But this power is expressly made subject to the limitation laid down in clause (3) quoted above; that is to say, where any case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution (omitting the words not material for our present purpose) the minimum number of Judges prescribed by the Constitution to decide such a case is five. A case may involve questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, as also other questions. In this case we have to determine whether clause (3) contemplates that whole case or a part of a case. In my opinion, the Constitution while laying down clause (3) of article 145 contemplates the whole matter in controversy arising in a case which may include substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution as also other questions. The main clause (3), excepting cases coming within the purview of the proviso does not contemplate a splitting up of a case into parts, one part involving substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution and another part or parts not involving such question. My reasons for coming to this conclusion are as follows :  \n  Clause (3) itself read along with the proviso makes a distinction between a \"case\" and a \"question\" of the nature indicated in the proviso to the clause. The Constitution has clearly indicated that cases coming within the purview of the proviso may be split up so as to admit of the questions of constitutional importance being determined by a Bench of at least five Judges who may be described for the sake of convenience as a \"Constitution Bench\" in contradistinction to a Division Court consisting of less than five Judges, as is contemplated in the proviso. The main clause (3) requires a case of the description therein set out to be heard and decided by a Constitution Bench, whereas the proviso contemplates that only the question of constitutional importance (using a compendious phrase) has to be decided by a Constitution Bench and the case out of which such a question arises remaining in the seisin of the Division Court before which the case was originally placed for hearing.  \n 19. The Constitution has placed cases involving substantial questions of law of constitutional importance on a special footing. If the framers of the Constitution had intended that not the whole case but only particular questions of the nature indicated had to be heard by a minimum number of five Judges, they would have used words similar to those used in the proviso making it permissible for the Constitution Bench to give its opinion for the decision of the case by a Division Court in conformity with that opinion.  \n 20. A reference to the terms of article 228 of the Constitution would also show that the framers of the Constitution were fully alive to the difference between the decision of the \"case itself\" and a \"question of law\" of constitutional importance involved in that case. It has made clear in that article that the High Court shall either decide whole case including the question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution which was necessary for the disposal of the case or determine only such a question or questions and return the case to the original court for disposal in conformity with the judgment of the High Court on such question or questions. The Constitution made these specific provisions to emphasize that there is a distinction between determining the case itself and determining a substantial question of law of constitutional importance.  \n 21. Can it be said that if clause (3) of article 145 had been enacted without the proviso, a case could be heard piecemeal first by a Constitution Bench which would determine only questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, and then the residue of the case being heard and determined by a Division Court ? That, in my opinion, would not be in compliance with the imperative provisions of the main clause (3). The framers of the Constitution therefore enacted the proviso in the nature of an exception to the general rule laid down in the main clause (3). It has to be observed that the proviso is limited to appeals only, subject to the further exception that such appeals should not have come up to this Court through the process laid down in article 132 of the Constitution. It is thus clear that not all cases contemplated in the main clause (3) but only appeals of a particular description would come within the qualifying provisions of the proviso.  \n 22. The word \"case\" has not been defined but it may be taken as settled law that it is much wider than a \"suit\" or an \"appeal.\" Hence whereas the proviso would apply to appeals brought up to this court, except those under article 132 of the Constitution, the main clause (3) would apply to all appeals and all other matters coming up to this Court in its Original, Appellate and Advisory jurisdictions. In my opinion, there cannot be the least doubt that the main provisions of clause (3) are all-embracing, and contemplate all cases coming up to this Court.  \n 23. It has not been contended that the present case comes within the purview of the proviso but it has been said that if it is open to a Division Court to refer a question of constitutional importance to a Constitution Bench, why should not a Constitution Bench be competent to refer questions other than those of constitutional importance to a Division Court ? The answer is that whereas the former is contemplated by the constitution in terms, the latter is not. Nor are there any rules to that effect.  \n 24. But it has been further observed that the splitting up of a case into parts, one involving questions of constitutional importance and the remaining part not involving questions of that kind, is not against the provisions of the Constitution. But, in my opinion, if the Constitution has made a specific provision as to the splitting up of a case into parts, one cognisable by a Court of higher jurisdiction like a Constitution Bench and the rest by a court of lower jurisdiction like a Division Court, the argument is not available that a splitting up of a case apart from those specific provisions is also permissible. In this connection reference was made to certain provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure as also of the Code of Criminal Procedure to show that those Codes do contemplate hearing of the same case in part by different courts, but those are all courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction in which the question of the power of the court itself relatively to the subject-matter of the case is not in question. The court which originally dealt with the case and the court which finally came to hear and determine the matter were each one of them competent to deal with the whole matter or any part of it. That is not the position here. In this case the argument on behalf of the petitioner is that as admittedly his appeal involved substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution and as it did not come within the purview of the proviso to clause (3) of article 145 of the Constitution, it should have been dealt with throughout by a Constitution Bench. It was suggested in answer to this argument that after the questions of law of constitutional importance had been dealt with by the Constitution Bench the case ceased to be one involving such questions and therefore could have been heard by a Division Court. But the difficulty in accepting this argument is that once a Constitution Bench was seized of the case, it could not transfer it to another Bench for sharing the decision of that case with it. That Bench should have heard out the whole case and it had not the power to direct, and it did not so direct, that the remaining part of the case should be heard by a Division Court. Once a Constitution Bench is seized of the case, it has to hear the case to its conclusion. There was no process known to the rules framed under the rule-making power of this Court by which a case one it came before a Constitution Bench could get transferred from that Bench to a Division Court either automatically or by orders of any authority. But it has been suggested that it may happen that a Constitution Bench may start the hearing of the case, and before the hearing is concluded one of the Judges is by reason of death or otherwise disabled from hearing out the case and in that event the Chief Justice has the power to constitute another Bench. But that is quite a different matter. In that case the hearing by the previous Bench comes to nothing and the Bench constituted afresh by the Chief Justice has to hear out the whole case afresh.  \n 25. It has also been suggested on the other side that a \"case\" may mean a part of a case. In my opinion, that submission is not well founded; because, if that argument were accepted and pushed to its logical conclusion, it may make the provisions of the main clause (3) of article 145 nugatory. Article 132 of the Constitution has been, as indicated above, excepted from the operation of the proviso to clause (3). Suppose an appeal is brought to this Court under article 132 of the Constitution as the case involved substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution. That case besides involving questions of that character, may also involve other questions. If the argument that a \"case\" includes part of a case were accepted, then it will be permissible for a Constitution Bench to hear the questions of Constitutional importance and leave the rest of the case to be determined by a Division Court, though such a case is expressly excluded from the operation of the proviso and thus is directly within the terms of the main clause (3). Hence every case coming before this Court involving a question of constitutional importance may be dealt with in part in so far as it relates to that question by a Constitution Bench and the remaining part by a Division Court. That, in my opinion, was not intended by the framers of the Constitution. The term \"case\" therefore must mean the whole matter in controversy before this Court. Such a matter may relate to one of several questions in controversy in the original court, if the determination of that question is sufficient to dispose of the case within the meaning of the Explanation to article 132 of the Constitution.  \n 26. It was further argued by the learned Attorney-General that the whole clause (3) of article 145 along with the proviso must be read together. But even so read, the language of clause (3) does not warrant the hearing of the case piecemeal by different Benches unless it comes within the purview of the proviso. The proviso is meant to cover only a limited class of cases which otherwise would have come within the purview of the main clause (3). But the proviso cannot have a larger effect than is justified by its language, viz., that only a question of that description has to be referred for the opinion of the larger Bench, the case itself remaining on the file of the smaller Bench. The proviso thus makes a clear distinction between a \"case\" and a \"question.\"  \n 27. It has also been said there is an inherent power in the court to transact its business according to its established practice. In the first place, this Court is still in its formative stages and it cannot be said to have an \"established practice.\" Secondly, it cannot establish a practice in the teeth of the provisions of the Constitution which it is pledged to uphold.  \n 28. The reference to the decision of the Privy Council in Moulvi Muhammad Abdul Majid v. Muhammad Abdul Aziz (L.R. 24 I.A. 22) is not apt because in that case the hearing at the two stages of the trial was to be done by a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction; that is to say, a court which could hear and determine the whole case or each of the two parts of the case taken separately by itself, unlike the present case in which the two parts of the hearing have been done by two courts of unequal power. Similarly the reference to the maxim \"cursus curiae est lex curiae\" of Coke C.J., in Burrowes v. High Commission Court (3 Bulst. 48, 53), referred to in Habibar Rahman v. Saidannessa Bibi (I.L.R. 51 Cal. 331, 335) and to the other cases all proceed on the assumption that there is nothing in the statute law against such a course being taken. But, in my opinion, such a nebulous practice is opposed to the positive provisions of clause (3) of article 145.\n 29. In my opinion, therefore, the present case comes directly within the main clause (3) of article 145 of the Constitution and is admittedly not covered by the proviso to that clause. That being so, the petitioner's appeal to this Court has not been heard and determined in accordance with the procedure established by this Constitution and therefore the petitioner is entitled to the benefit of the protection afforded by article 21 of the Constitution. His appeal, therefore, has got to be heard and determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 145(3) of the Constitution. I would therefore allow the petition to this extent only that the appeal be heard by a Constitution Bench on a declaration that the judgment of the Division Court dated the 5th March, 1954 is not that of a competent court.  \n By The Court  \n \n\n 30. In accordance with the judgment of the majority, the petition is dismissed.  \n"}, {"id": "1626315", "date": "4/1955", "tagline": "Shiva Jute Baling Ltd vs Hindley & Co.

This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution, preferred by six persons, who purport to carry on the business of preparing, printing publishing and selling text books for different classes in the schools of Punjab, particularly for the primary and middle classes, under the name and style \"Uttar Chand Kapur & Sons.\" It is alleged that the Education Department of the Punjab Government has in pursuance of their so-called policy of nationalisation of text books, issued a series of notifications since 1950 regarding the printing, publication and sale of these books which have not only placed unwarrantable restrictions upon the rights of the petitioners to carry on their business but have practically ousted them and other fellow-traders from the business altogether. It is said that no restrictions could be imposed upon the petitioners' right to carry on the trade which is guaranteed under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution by mere executive orders without proper legislation and that the legislation, if any, must conform to the requirements of clause (6) of article 19 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the petitioners pray for writs in the nature of mandamus directing the Punjab Government to withdraw the notifications which have affected their rights.  \n 2. To appreciate the contentions that have been raised by the learned counsel who appeared for the parties before us, it will be necessary to narrate certain relevant facts. In the State of Punjab, all recognised schools have got to follow the course of studies approved by the Education Department of the Government and the use, by the pupils, of the text books prescribed or authorised by the Department is a condition precedent to the granting of recognition to a school. For a long period of time prior to 1950, the method adopted by the Government for selection and approval of text books for recognised schools was commonly known as the alternative method and the procedure followed was shortly this : Books on relevant subjects, in accordance with the principles laid down by the Education Department, were prepared by the publishers with their own money and under their own arrangements and they were submitted for approval of the Government. The Education Department after proper scrutiny selected books numbering between 3 and 10 or even more on each subject as alternative text books, leaving it to the discretion of the Head Masters of the different schools, to select any one of the alternative books on particular subject out of the approved list. The Government fixed the prices as well as the size and contents of the books and when these things were done it was left to the publishers to print, publish and sell the books to the pupils of different schools according to the choice made by their respective Head Masters. Authors, who were not publishers, could also submit books for approval and if any of their books were approved, they had to make arrangements for publishing the same and usually they used to select some one of the publishers already on the line to do the work.  \n 3. This procedure, which was in vogue since 1905, was altered in material particulars on and from May 1950. By certain resolutions of the Government passed on or about that time, the whole of the territory of Punjab, as it remained in the Indian Union after partition, was divided into three Zones. The text books on certain subjects like agriculture, history, social studies, etc., for all the zones were prepared and published by the Government without inviting them from the publishers. With respect to the remaining subjects, offers were still invited from \"publishers and authors\" but the alternative system was given up and only one text book on each subject for each class in a particular zone was selected. Another changes introduced at this time was that the Government charged, as royalty, 5% on the sale price of all the approved text books. The result therefore was that the Government at this time practically took upon themselves the monopoly of publishing the text books on some of the subjects and with regard to the rest also, they reserved for themselves a certain royalty upon the sale proceeds.  \n 4. Changes of a far more drastic character however were introduced in the year 1952 by a notification of the Education Department issued on the 9th of August, 1952 and it is against this notification that the complaints of the petitioners are mainly directed. This notification omitted the word \"publishers\" altogether and invited only the \"authors and others\" to submit books for approval by the Government. These \"authors and others, \" whose books were selected, had to enter into agreements in the form prescribed by the Government and the principal terms of the agreement were that the copyright in these books would vest absolutely in the Government and the \"authors and others\" would only get a royalty at the rate of 5% on the sale of the text books at the price or prices specified in the list. Thus the publishing, printing and selling of the books were taken by the Government exclusively in their own hands and the private publishers were altogether ousted from this business. The 5% royalty, in substance, represents the price for the sale of the copyright and it is paid to an author or any other person who, not being the author, is the owner of the copyright and is hence competent in law to transfer the same of the Government. It is against these notifications of 1950 and 1952 that the present petition under article 32 of the Constitution is directed and the petitioners pray for withdrawal of these notifications on the ground that they contravene the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under the Constitution.  \n 5. The contentions raised by Mr. Pathak, who appeared in support of the petitioners, are of a three-fold character. It is contended in the first place that the executive Government of a State is wholly incompetent, without any legislative sanction, to engage in any trade or business activity and that the acts of the Government in carrying out their policy of establishing monopoly in the business of printing and publishing text books for school students is wholly without jurisdiction and illegal. His second contention is, that assuming that the State could create a monopoly in its favour in respect of a particular trade or business, that could be done not by any executive act but by means of a proper legislation which should conform to the requirements of article 19(6) of the Constitution. Lastly, it is argued that it was not open to the Government to deprive the petitioners of their interest in any business or undertaking which amounts to property without authority of law and without payment of compensation as is required under article 31 of the Constitution.  \n 6. The first point raised by Mr. Pathak, in substance, amounts to this, that the Government has no power in law to carry on the business of printing or selling text books for the use of school students in competition with private agencies without the sanction of the legislature. It is not argued that the functions of a modern State like the police States of old are confined to mere collection of taxes or maintenance of laws and protection of the realm from external or internal enemies. A modern State is certainly expected to engage in all activities necessary for the promotion of the social and economic welfare of the community. What Mr. Pathak says, however, is, that as our Constitution clearly recognises a division of governmental functions into three categories, viz., the legislative, the judicial and the executive, the function of the executive cannot but be to execute the laws passed by the legislature or to supervise the enforcement of the same. The legislature must first enact a measure which the executive can then carry out. The learned counsel has, in support of this contention, placed considerable reliance upon articles 73 and 162 of our Constitution and also upon certain decided authorities of the Australian High Court to which we shall presently refer.  \n 7. Article 73 of the Constitution relates to the executive powers of the Union, while the corresponding provision in regard to the executive powers of a State is contained in article 162. The provisions of these articles are analogous to those of section 8 and 49 respectively of the Government of India Act, 1935 and lay down the rule of distribution of executive powers between the Union and the States, following the same analogy as is provided in regard to the distribution of legislative powers between them. Article 162, with which we are directly concerned in this case, lays down :  \n \"Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws :  \n Provided that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a State and Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of the State shall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power expressly conferred by this Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities thereof.\"   \n 8. Thus under this article the executive authority of the State is executive in respect to matters enumerated in List II of Seventh Schedule. The authority also extends to the Concurrent List except as provided in the Constitution itself or in any law passed by the Parliament. Similarly, article 73 provides that the executive powers of the Union shall extend to matters with respect to which the Parliament has power to made laws and to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by the Government of India by virtue of any treaty or any agreement. The proviso engrafted on clause (1) further lays down that although with regard to the matters in the Concurrent List the executive authority shall be ordinarily left to be State it would be open to the Parliament to provide that in exceptional cases the executive power of the Union shall extend to these matters also. Neither of these articles contain any definition as to what the executive function is and what activities would legitimately come within its scope. They are concerned primarily with the distribution of the executive power between the Union on the one hand and the States on the other. They do not mean, as Mr. Pathak seems to suggest, that it is only when the Parliament or the State Legislature has legislated on certain items appertaining to their respective lists, that the Union or the State executive, as the case may be, can proceed to function in respect to them. On the other hand, the language of article 162 clearly indicates that the powers of the State executive do extend to matters upon which the state Legislature is competent to legislate and are not confined to matters over which legislation has been passed already. The same principle underlies article 73 of the Constitution. These provisions of the Constitution therefore do not lend any support to Mr. Pathak's contention.  \n 9. The Australian cases upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel do not, in our opinion, appear to be of much help either. In the first (The Commonwealth and the Central Wool Committee v. The Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., 31 C.L.R. 421) of these cases, the executive Government of the Commonwealth, during the continuance of the war, entered into a number of agreements with a company which was engaged in the manufacture and sale of wool-tops. The agreements were of different types. By one class of agreements, the Commonwealth Government gave consent to the sale of wool-tops by the company in return for a share of the profits of the transactions (called by the parties \"a licence fee\"). Another class provided that the business of manufacturing wool-tops should be carried on by the company as agents for the Commonwealth in consideration of the company receiving an annual sum from the Commonwealth. The rest of the agreements were a combination of these two varieties. It was held by a Full Bench of the High Court that apart from any authority conferred by an Act of Parliament or by regulations thereunder, the executive Government of the Commonwealth had no power to make or rectify any of these agreement. The decision, it may be noticed, was based substantially upon the provision of section 61 of the Australian Constitution which is worded as follows :  \n  \"The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercised by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative and extends to the execution and maintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth.\"  \n 10. In addition to this, the King could assign other functions and powers to the Governor-General under section 2 but in this particular case no assignment of any additional powers was alleged or proved. The court held that the agreements were not directly authorised by the Parliament or under the provisions of any statute and as they were not for the execution and maintenance of the Constitution they must be held to be void. Isacs, J., in his judgment, dealt elaborately with the two types of agreements and held that the agreements, so far as they purported to bind the company to pay to the Government money, as the price of consents, amounted to the imposition of a tax and were void without the authority of Parliament. The other kind of agreements which purported to bind the Government to pay to the company a remuneration for manufacturing wool-tops was held to be an appropriation of public revenue and being without legislative authority was also void.  \n 11. It will be apparent that none of the principles indicated above could have any application to the circumstances of the present case. There is no provision in our Constitution corresponding to section 61 of the Australian Act. The Government has not imposed anything like taxation or licence fee in the present case nor have we been told that the appropriation of public revenue involved in the so-called business in text books carried on by the Government has not been sanctioned by the legislature by proper Appropriation Acts.  \n 12. The other case (Vide Attorney-General for Victoria v. The Commonwealth, 52 C.L.R. 533) is of an altogether different character and arose in the following way. The Commonwealth Government had established a clothing factory in Melbourne for the purpose of making naval and military uniforms for the defence forces and postal employees. In times of peace the operations of the factory included the supply of uniforms for other departments of the Commonwealth and for employees in various public utility services. The Governor-General deemed such peace-time operations of the factory necessary for the efficient defence of the Commonwealth inasmuch as the maintenance intact of the trained complement of the factory would assist in meeting wartime demands. A question arose as to whether operations of the factory for such purposes in peace-time were authorised by the Defence Act. The majority of the Court answered the question in the affirmative, Starke, J. delivered dissenting opinion upon which Mr. Pathak mainly relied. The learned Judge laid stress on section 61 of the Constitution Act according to which the executive power of the Commonwealth extended to the maintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth and held that there was nothing in the Constitution or any law of the Commonwealth which enabled the Commonwealth to establish and maintain clothing factories for other than Commonwealth purposes. The opinion, whether right or wrong, turns upon the particular facts of the case and upon the provision of section 61 of the Australian Act and it cannot and does not throw any light on the question that requires decision in the present case.  \n 13. A question very similar to that in the present case did arise for consideration before a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Motilal v. The Government of the State of Uttar Pradesh . The point canvassed there was whether the Government of a State has power under the Constitution to carry on the trade or business of running a bus service in the absence of a legislative enactment authorising the State Government to do so. Different views were expressed by different Judges on this question. Chief Justice Malik was of opinion that in a written Constitution like ours the executive power may be such as is given to the executive or is implied, ancillary or inherent. It must include all powers that may be needed to carry into effect the aims and objects of the Constitution. It must mean more than merely executing the laws. According to the chief Justice the State has a right to hold and manage its own property and carry on such trade or business as a citizen has the right to carry on, so long as such activity does not encroach upon the rights of others or is not contrary to law. The running of a transport business therefore was not per se outside the ambit of the executive authority of the State. Sapru, J., held that the power to run a Government bus service was incidental to the power of acquiring property which was expressly conferred by article 298 of the Constitution. Mootham and Wanchoo, JJ., who delivered a common judgment, were also of the opinion that there was no need for a specific legislative enactment to enable a State Government to run a bus service. In the opinion of these learned Judges an act would be within the executive power of the State if it is not an act which has been assigned by the Constitution of India to other authorities or bodies and is not contrary to the provisions of any law and does not encroach upon the legal rights of any member of the public. Agarwala, J., dissented from the majority view and held that the State Government had no power to run a bus service in the absence of an Act of the legislature authorising the State to do so. The opinion of Agarwala, J., undoubtedly supports the contention of Mr. Pathak but it appears to us to be too narrow and unsupportable.  \n 14. It may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of what executive function means and implies. Ordinarily the executive power connotes the residue of governmental functions that remain after legislative and judicial functions are taken away. The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the doctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but the functions of the different parts or branches of the Government have been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can very well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate assumption, by one organ or part of the State, of functions that essentially belong to another. The executive indeed can exercise the powers of departmental or subordinate legislation when such powers are delegated to it by the legislature. It can also, when so empowered, exercise judicial functions in a limited way. The executive Government, however, can never go against the provisions of the Constitution or of any law. This is clear from the provisions of article 154 of the Constitution but, as we have already stated, it does not follow from this that in order to enable the executive to function there must be a law already in existence and that the powers of executive are limited merely to the carrying out of these laws.  \n 15. The limits within which the executive Government can function under the Indian Constitution can be ascertained without much difficulty by reference to the form of the executive which our Constitution has set up. Our Constitution, though federal in its structure, is modelled on the British Parliamentary system where the executive is deemed to have the primary responsibility for the formulation of governmental policy and its transmission into law though the condition precedent to the exercise of this responsibility is its retaining the confidence of the legislative branch of the State. The executive function comprises both the determination of the policy as well as carrying it into execution. This evidently includes the initiation of legislation, the maintenance of order, the promotion of social and economic welfare, the direction of foreign policy, in fact the carrying on or supervision of the general administration of the State.  \n 16. In India, as in England, the executive has to act subject to the control of the legislature; but in what way is this control exercised by the legislature ? Under article 53(1) of our Constitution, the executive power of the Union is vested in the President but under article 75 there is to be a Council of Minister with the Prime Minister at the head to aid advise the President in the exercise of his functions. The president has thus been made a formal or constitutional head of the executive and the real executive powers are vested in the Ministers or the Cabinet. The same provisions obtain in regard to the Government of States; the Governor or the Rajpramukh, as the case may be, occupies the position of the head of the executive in the State but it is virtually the council of Ministers in each State that carries on the executive Government. In the Indian Constitution, therefore, we have the same system of parliamentary executive as in England and the council of Ministers consisting, as it does, of the members of the legislature is, like the British Cabinet, \"a hyphen which joins, a buckle which fastens the legislative part of the State to the executive part.\" The Cabinet enjoying, as it does, a majority in the legislature concentrates in itself the virtual control of both legislative and executive functions; and as the Ministers constituting the Cabinet are presumably agreed on fundamentals and act on the principle of collective responsibility, the most important questions of policy are all formulated by them.  \n 17. Suppose now that the Ministry or the executive Government of a State formulates a particular policy in furtherance of which they want to start trade or business. Is it necessary that there must be a specific legislation legalising such trade activities before they could be embarked upon ? We cannot say that such legislation is always necessary. If the trade or business involves expenditure of funds, it is certainly required that Parliament should authorise such expenditure either directly or under the provisions of a statute. What is generally done in such cases is, that the sums required for carrying on the business are entered in the annual financial statement which the Ministry has to lay before the House or Houses of Legislature in respect of every financial year under article 202 of the Constitution. So much of the estimates as relate to expenditure other than those charged on the consolidated fund are submitted in the form of demands for grants to the legislature and the legislature has the power to assent or refuse to assent to any such demand or assent to a demand subject to reduction of the amount (article 203). After the grant is sanctioned, an Appropriation Bill is introduced to provide for the appropriation out of the consolidated fund of the State of all moneys required to meet the grants thus made by the Assembly (article 204). As soon as the Appropriation Act is passed, the expenditure made under the heads covered by it would be deemed to be properly authorised by law under article 266(3) of the Constitution.  \n 18. It may be, as Mr. Pathak contends, that the Appropriation Acts are no substitute for specific legislation and that they validate only the expenses out of the consolidated funds for the particular years for which they are passed; but nothing more than that may be necessary for carrying on of the trade or business. Under article 266(3) of the Constitution no moneys out of the consolidated funds of India or the consolidated fund of a State shall be appropriated except in accordance with law and for the purposes and in the manner provided in this Constitution. The expression \"law\" here obviously includes the Appropriation Acts. It is true that the Appropriation Acts cannot be said to give a direct legislative sanction to the trade activities themselves. But so long as the trade activities are carried on in pursuance of the policy which the executive Government has formulated with the tacit support of the majority in the legislature, no objection on the score of their not being sanctioned by specific legislative provision can possibly be raised. Objections could be raised only in regard to the expenditure of public funds for carrying on of the trade or business and to these the Appropriation Acts would afford complete answer.  \n 19. Specific legislation may indeed be necessary if the Government require certain powers in addition to what they possess under ordinary law in order to carry on the particular trade or business. Thus when it is necessary to encroach upon private rights in order to enable the Government to carry on their business, a specific legislation sanctioning such course would have to be passed.  \n 20. In the present case it is not disputed that the entire expenses necessary for carrying on the business of printing and publishing the text books for recognised schools in Punjab were estimated and shown in the annual financial statement and that the demands for grants, which were made under different heads, were sanctioned by the State Legislature and due Appropriation Acts were passed. For the purpose of carrying on the business the Government do not require any additional powers and whatever is necessary for their purpose, they can have by entering into contracts with authors and other people. This power of contract is expressly vested in the Government under article 298 of the Constitution. In these circumstances, we are unable to agree with Mr. Pathak that the carrying on of the business of printing and publishing text books was beyond the competence of the executive Government without a specific legislation sanctioning such course.  \n 21. These discussions however are to some extent academic and are not sufficient by themselves to dispose of the petitioners' case. As we have said already, the executive Government are bound to conform not only to the law of the land but also to the provisions of the Constitution. The Indian Constitution is a written Constitution and even the legislature cannot override the fundamental rights guaranteed by it to the citizens. Consequently, even if the acts of the executive are deemed to be sanctioned by the legislature, yet they can be declared to be void and inoperative if they infringe any of the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. On the other hand, even if the acts of the executive are illegal in the sense that they are not warranted by law, but no fundamental rights of the petitioners have been infringed thereby, the latter would obviously have no right to complain under article 32 of the Constitution though they may have remedies elsewhere if other heads of rights are infringed. The material question for consideration therefore is : What fundamental rights of the petitioners, if any, have been violated by the notifications and acts of the executive Government of Punjab undertaken by them in furtherance of their policy of nationalisation of the text books for the school students ?  \n 22. The petitioners claim fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution which guarantees, inter alia, to all persons the right to carry on any trade or business. The business which the petitioners have been carrying on is that of printing and publishing books for sale including text books used in the primary and middle classes of the schools in Punjab. Ordinarily it is for the school authorities to prescribe the text books that are to be used by the students and if these text books are available in the market the pupils can purchase them from any book-seller they like. There is no fundamental right in the publishers that any of the books printed and published by them should be prescribed as text books by the school authorities or if they are once accepted as text books they cannot be stopped or discontinued in future. With regard to the schools which are recognised by the Government the position of the publishers is still worse. The recognised schools receive aids of various kinds from the Government including grants for the maintenance of the institutions, for equipments, furniture, scholarships and other things and the pupils of the recognised schools are admitted to the school final examinations at lower rates of fees than those demanded from the students of non-recognised schools. Under the school code, one of the main conditions upon which recognition is granted by Government is that the school authorities must use as text books only those which are prescribed or authorised by the Government. So far therefore as the recognised schools are concerned and we are concerned only with these schools in the present case the choice of text books rests entirely with the Government and it is for the Government to decide in which way the selection of these text books is to be made. The procedure hitherto followed was that the Government used to invite publishers and authors to submit their books for examination and approval by the Education Department and after selection was made by the Government, the size, contents as well as the prices of the books were fixed and it was left to the publishers or authors to print and publish them and offer them for sale to the pupils. So long as this system was in vogue the only right which publishers, like the petitioners had, was to offer their books for inspection and approval by the Government. They had no right to insist on any of their books being accepted as text books. So the utmost that could be said is that there was merely a chance or prospect of any or some of their books being approved as text books by the Government. Such chances are incidental to all trades and business and there is no fundamental right guaranteeing them. A trader might be lucky in the securing a particular market for his goods but if he looses that field because the particular customers for some reason or other do not choose to buy goods from him, it is not open to him to say that it was his fundamental right to have his old customers for ever. On the one hand, therefore, there was nothing but a chance or prospect which the publishers had of having their books approved by the Government, on the other hand the Government had the undisputed right to adopt any method of selection they liked and if they ultimately decided that after approving the text books they would purchase the copyright in them from the authors and others provided the latter were willing to transfer the same to the Government on certain terms, we fail to see what right of the publishers to carry on their trade or business is affected by it. Nobody is taking away the publishers' right to print and publish any books they like and to offer them for sale but if they have no right that their books should be approved as text books by the Government it is immaterial so far as they are concerned whether the Government approves of text books submitted by other persons who are willing to sell their copyrights in the books to them, or choose to engage authors for the purpose of preparing the text books which they take up on themselves to print and publish. We are unable to appreciate the argument of Mr. Pathak that the Government while exercising their undoubted right of approval cannot attach to it a condition which has no bearing on the purpose for which the approval is made. We fail to see how the petitioners' position is in any way improved thereby. The action of the Government may be good or bad. It may be criticised and condemned in the Houses of the Legislature or outside but this does not amount to an infraction of the fundamental right guaranteed by article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.  \n23. As in our view the petitioners have no fundamental right in the present case which can be said to have been infringed by the action of the Government, the petition is bound to fail on that ground. This being the position, the other two points raised by Mr. Pathak do not require consideration at all. As the petitioners have no fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, the question whether the Government could establish a monopoly without any legislation under article 19(6) of the Constitution is altogether immaterial. Again a mere chance or prospect of having particular customers cannot be said to be a right to property or to any interest in an undertaking within the meaning of article 31(2) of the Constitution and no question of payment of compensation can arise because the petitioners have been deprived of the same. The result is that the petition is dismissed with costs.  \n PETITIONS NOS. 71 TO 77 AND 85 OF 1955.  \n Mukherjea, C.J. \n 24. These 8 petitions under article 32 of the Constitution raise identically the same points for consideration as are involved in Petition No. 652 of 1954 just disposed of. The petitioners in these cases also purport to be printers, publishers and sellers of text-books for various classes in the schools of Punjab and they complain of infraction of their fundamental rights under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution by reason of the various notifications issued by the State of Punjab in pursuance of their policy of nationalisation of text books. The learned counsel appearing in these cases have adopted in their entirely the arguments that have been advanced by Mr. Pathak in Petition No. 652 of 1954 and no fresh or additional argument has been put forward by any one of them. This being the position the decision in Petition No. 652 of 1954 will govern these petitions also and they will stand dismissed but we would make no order as to costs.  \n"}, {"id": "1126538", "date": "4/1955", "tagline": "M.

By notification issued on 16-2-1952,\tthe\n       Act came into force on 18-2-1952.  In pursuance of s.  21(1)\n       of  the\tAct, the State of  Rajasthan  issued  notifications\n       resuming\t the jagirs specified therein, whereupon  petitions\n       under Art. 226 of the Constitution were filed by the persons\n       aggrieved  challenging  the validity of the Act\tbefore\tthe\n       Rajasthan  High\tCourt.\tThe petitions  were  dismissed\tand\n       thereupon  they\tfiled petitions before\tthe  Supreme  Court\n       under  Art. 32 of the Constitution of India,  impugning\tthe\n       Act.   They contended inter alia that the Rajpramukh had\t no\n       competence to enact the law, that the Bill was not  prepared\n       by  the\tRajpramakh  as\trequired  by  Art.  212-A(2),  that\n       resumption  was\tnot  one  of  the  topics  of\tlegislation\n       enumerated  either  in the State List or in  the\t Concurrent\n       List  in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution  and  that\n       the  Act was therefore ultra vires the powers of the  State,\n       that  the Act did not provide for adequate compensation\tnor\n       was there any public purpose involved in it and therefore it\n       contravened  Art. 31(2), and that as the Act  was  discrimi-\n       natory  it  contravened Art. 14.\t There\twere  some  special\n       contentions that the Act was not saved by Art. 31-A, because\n       the lands resumed were neither estates nor jagirs nor grants\n       similar\tto  jagirs,  inams or muafi and that  some  of\tthe\n       properties  sought to be resumed were not jagirs as  defined\n       in  the Act and therefore the notifications under s.  21\t of\n       the Act in so far as they related to them were illegal.\n       39\n       304\n       Held that, (1) the Rajpramukh was competent to enact the im-\n       pugned  law,  under  Art.  385,\tas  he\twas  the  authority\n       functioning  immediately\t before\t the  commencement  of\tthe\n       Constitution  as the legislature of Rajasthan under art.\t  X\n       (3)  of the Covenant of the United State of Rajasthan.\tThe\n       expression  \"Ordinance\" in art.\tX (3) must be construed\t as\n       meaning\t\"Law\".\t Article  VII  (3)  of\tthe  Covenant\thas\n       reference  to  the executive power which the Rulers  had\t to\n       resume  jagirs and does not operate as a restriction on\tthe\n       legislative  powers under art.  X (3).  The  Legislature\t of\n       the corresponding State mentioned in Art. 385 refers not\t to\n       the  legislature under the Constitution, but to the body\t or\n       the  authority which was functioning as the  legislature\t of\n       the  State before the commencement of the  Constitution\tand\n       under  Art.   X (3) of the Covenant of the United  State\t of\n       Rajasthan, that authority was the Rajpramukh.\n       Article 385 does not require that that authority should have\n       had absolute and unlimited powers of legislation.  If it was\n       functioning   as\t the  legislative  authority   before\tthe\n       Constitution,  it  would, under the article,  have  all\tthe\n       powers conferred by the Constitution on the House or  Houses\n       of legislature of the States.\n       (ii) Article  212-A(2)  which provides that  the\t Rajpramukh\n       should  prepare\tthe Bill, does not require that\t he  should\n       himself draft it.  It is sufficient if he decides  questions\n       of  policy which are of the essence of the legislation.\t It\n       is  open to the Rajpramukh to adopt a Bill prepared  by\this\n       ministers  and  the only matter that will have  to  be  con-\n       sidered is whether in fact he did so.  There is no provision\n       in Art. 212-A(2) for the Rajpramukh approving of a Bill\tand\n       an  endorsement\tof  approval on the Bill  prepared  in\tthe\n       ministerial  department must therefore signify its  adoption\n       by  him.\t When the Bill is produced with an  endorsement\t of\n       approval\t under his signature, the question must be held\t to\n       be   concluded\tand  any  further  discussion\tabout\tthe\n       legislative  or\texecutive state of mind of  the\t Rajpramukh\n       must be ruled out as inadmissible.\n       (iii)\t The impugned Act is not ultra vires the powers\t of\n       the   State  Legislature\t as  the  subject-matter  of   the-\n       legislation  is\tin  substance  acquisition  of\t properties\n       falling\tunder entry 36 of List II of the Seventh  Schedule.\n       Resumption  and acquisition connote two different  concepts,\n       but  whether  the  impugned Act is one  for  acquisition\t of\n       jagirs or for their resumption must be determined with  ref-\n       erence  to  the pith and substance of the  legislation,\tthe\n       name  given to it by the legislature not being  decisive\t of\n       the  matter.  The resumption for which the Act  provides\t is\n       not  in\tenforcement of the rights which the Rulers  had\t to\n       resume  jagirs in accordance with the terms of the grant\t or\n       the  law applicable to it, but in exercise of the  sovereign\n       rights of eminent domain possessed by the State.\t Under\tthe\n       circumstances, the taking of the properties is in  substance\n       acquisition   notwithstanding   that  it\t is   labelled\t as\n       resumption.\n       The  payment of compensation to the Jagirdars is\t consistent\n       only with the taking being an acquisition and not resumption\n       in\n\t\t\t\t   305\n       accordance with the terms of the grant or the law applicable\n       to it.  Though the legislation also falls under entry 18\t of\n       List  II\t of the Seventh Schedule, there being an  entry\t 36\n       dealing with acquisition, it must be held that the Act falls\n       under that entry and is valid.\n       (iv) The\t word  'jagir' connoted originally grants  made\t by\n       Rajput  Rulers  to  their  clansmen  for\t military  services\n       rendered\t or  to\t be rendered.  Later  on  grants  made\tfor\n       religious  and charitable purposes and even  to\tnon-Rajputs\n       were  called  jagirs,  and both in  its\tpopular\t sense\tand\n       legislative  practice,  the word jagir came to  be  used\t as\n       connoting all grants which conferred on the grantees  rights\n       in  respect of land revenue, and that is the sense in  which\n       the word jagir should be construed in Art. 31-A.\n       The  object of Art. 31-A was to save legislation\t which\twas\n       directed\t to  the  abolition  of\t intermediaries\t so  as\t to\n       establish  direct  relationship between the  State  and\tthe\n       tillers\tof  the soil.  Construing the word  in\tthat  sense\n       which would achieve that object in full measure, it must\t be\n       held  that jagir was meant to cover all grants  under  which\n       the grantees had only rights in respect of revenue and  were\n       not  tillers of the soil.

The Bhomicharas are the  representatives\n       of Rajput Rulers who conquered the. country and\testablished\n       their sovereignty over it in the thirteenth century.   Later\n       on  the\tRuler of Jodhpur imposed his sovereignty  over\tthe\n       territory  but permitted the previous rulers to continue\t in\n       possession  of the lands on payment of an annual\t sum.\tThe\n       question was whether they held the lands as jagirs.\n       Held that, there could be a jagir only by grant by the  Rul-\n       ing  power  but that such a grant need not be  express,\tand\n       could  be implied and when the Ruler of Jodhpur imposed\this\n       sovereignty  over  the  territory  of  the  Bhomicharas\tbut\n       recognised their possession of the lands, it is as if  there\n       was annexation by him and re-grant to them of these lands.\n       Vajesinghji Joravar Singji and Others v. Secretary of  State\n       [(1924)\tL.R. 51 I.A. 357] and Secretary of State v.  Sardar\n       Bustam Khan [(1941) L.R. 68 I.A. 109], referred to.\n       Though  the Bhomicharas enjoyed large powers,  their  status\n       was  only that of subjects.  The status of a person must\t be\n       either  that  of\t a sovereign or a  subject.   There  is\t no\n       tertium\tquid.  The law does not recognise  an  intermediate\n       status  of  a person being partly a sovereign and  partly  a\n       subject.\t And when once it is admitted that the\tBhomicharas\n       had  acknowledged the sovereignty of Jodhpur,  their  status\n       can only be that of a subject.\n       Even  if the Bhomicharas did not prior to the  enactment\t of\n       the  Marwar  Land Revenue Act XL of 1949 hold the  lands\t as\n       grantees\n       306\n       from  the  State, they must be deemed to\t have  become  such\n       grantees\t by force of s. 169 of the Act which provides  that\n       all  lands  in  the  State vest in  the\tMaharajah  and\tall\n       proprietary interests therein are deemed to be held under  a\n       grant  from  him.   The Bbomicharas bad by  long\t usage\tand\n       recognition  and\t by the legislative practice of\t the  State\n       come  to\t be recognised as jagirdars and their tenure  is  a\n       jagir within the intendment of s. 169.\n       For  the purposes of Art. 31-A, it would make no\t difference\n       whether\tthe grant is made by the sovereign in the  exercise\n       of  his\tprerogative  right or by  the  legislature  in\tthe\n       exercise\t of  its  sovereign rights, Grants  which  are\tthe\n       creatures of statutes called legislative grants are  equally\n       within the operation of that article.\n       Bhomicharas  are, accordingly, within the operation of  Art.\n       31-A.\n       (vi) The position of Bhumias in Mewar is similar to that\t of\n       Bhomicharas in Marwar and in addition it was a condition\t of\n       the  terms on which their title to the lands was\t recognised\n       by  the\trulers of Chittoor and Udaipur, that  they  had\t to\n       render  military service when called upon and also pay  quit\n       rent.   Their  title  to the lands therefore  rested  on\t an\n       implied\tgrant and their tenure would be jagir even  in\tits\n       stricter sense.\n       Section\t27  of the Mewar Government Kanoon Mal\tAct  (V\t of\n       1947) enacts that all lands belong to His Highness and  that\n       no  person  has authority to take possession  of\t any  lands\n       unless  the right is granted by His Highness.   Section\t106\n       (1) of the Act declares that a Tikanadar, Jagirdar, Muafidar\n       or  Bhumia shall have all such revenue rights in\t the  lands\n       comprised  in his jagir, muafi, or Bhom under this  Act,\t as\n       are  granted to him by His Highness\".  The effect  of  these\n       provisions  was\tto impress on the Bhom tenure  the  charac-\n       teristics of a grant.\n       Article 13, Clause (1) of the Constitution of Mewar provided\n       that,  \"no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty\t or\n       property without due process of law, nor shall any person be\n       denied  equality\t before the law within the  territories\t of\n       Mewar\".\t It  was  contended for the  petitioners  that\tthe\n       impugned Act was void as contravening the above\tprovisions.\n       Held  that, as the authority which enacted the  Constitution\n       of Mewar was His Highness, it could be repealed or  modified\n       by the same authority, and the impugned Act must be held\t to\n       have repealed the Constitution to the extent that it was in-\n       consistent with it.\n       (vii)\t The Tikanadars of Shekwati got into possession\t of\n       lands as ijaradars or lessees and were subsequently  treated\n       as  jagirdars.\tTheir tenure was, if not jagirs,  at  least\n       other \"similar grants\" within Art. 31-A.\t It is included\t in\n       Schedule I to the impugned Act as item 6.\n       The  nature  of\tthe tenures of lands  held  by\tSubeguzars,\n       Mansubdars,  maintenance holders (Lawazma and  Kothrikarch),\n       Tikanadars   and\t  of  Naqdirazan,  Sansan   grants,   etc.,\n       considered,\n\t\t\t\t   307\n       (viii)\t The  Khandela\testate\twas granted in\t1836  on  a\n       permanent  lease.   The\tdefinition  of\tjagir  in  s.  2(h)\n       includes the tenures mentioned in Schedule I to the Act\tand\n       Istimrari tenure is item 2 therein. The question was whether\n       the Istimrar-ijara was within item 2.\n       Held  that, the essential features of Istimrari\ttenure\tare\n       that the lands are assessed to a nominal quit rent, and that\n       it  is  permanent.   The\t amount\t of  Rs.  80,001  fixed\t as\n       assessment  under  the  deed of 1836 cannot be  said  to\t be\n       nominal.\t The grant is, therefore, not an Istimrari  tenure,\n       but a permanent Izara.\n       (ix) Objections raised as to the validity of the Act on\tthe\n       ground that it did not provide for payment of  compensation,\n       that there was no public purpose involved in the\t resumption\n       and  that  therefore it contravenes Art. 31(2) or  that\tthe\n       provisions  of  the Act offend Art. 14, are  barred  by\tthe\n       provisions of Art. 31-A of the Constitution.\n       Even apart from Art. 31-A, the impugned Act must be held\t to\n       be  supported by public purpose and is not in  contravention\n       of Art. 31(2).  Nor is there a contravention of Art. 14,\t as\n       under the Act all jagirs are liable to be resumed, no  power\n       having been conferred on the Government to grant exemption.\n       State  of  Bihar v.

Assuming but not deciding that in dealing  with\n       an  appeal under s. 76 of the Act from the decisions of\tthe\n       Registrar  under\t s.  13 of the Act the High  Court  is\tnot\n       fettered\t by reason of the Registrar, on the hearing  before\n       him, having exercised his discretion and the High Court\tmay\n       exercise\t its  own  discretion,\tjust as\t it  could  if\tthe\n       proceedings  had been taken initially before it, it must\t be\n       remembered  that\t it is the Registrar to whom in\t the  first\n       instance\t is  committed the discretionary  power.   If  that\n       authority has exercised his discretion in good faith and not\n       in  violation of any law such exercise of discretion  should\n       not  be\tinterfered  with by the High Court  merely  on\tthe\n       ground that, in the opinion of the High Court it could  have\n       been exercised differently or even that the High Court would\n       have  exercised it differently, bad the matter been  brought\n       before  it  in the first instance.  The proper  approach\t in\n       such  a case is for the High Court to consider  whether\tthe\n       Registrar  has really gone so wrong as to make it  necessary\n       to interfere with his discretion.\n       The real purpose of requiring a disclaimer is to define\tthe\n       rights  of  the\tproprietor  under  registration\t so  as\t to\n       minimise,   even\t  if  it  cannot  wholly   eliminate,\tthe\n       possibility  of\textravagant and unauthorised  claims  being\n       made on the score of registration of the trade marks.\n       The  proviso to s. 13 preserves intact any right\t which\tthe\n       pro-.  prietor  may otherwise under any other  law  have\t in\n       relation to the mark or any part thereof.  The disclaimer is\n       only  for the purposes of the Act.  It does not\taffect\tthe\n       rights  of  the\tproprietor except such\t-as  arise  out\t of\n       registration.  That is to say, the special advantages  which\n       the  Act\t gives to the proprietor by reason  of\tthe  regis-\n       tration\tof  his trade mark do not extend to  the  parts\t or\n       matters which he disclaims.\n       Held, that considering all the circumstances of the  present\n       case  the  Registrar  had not gone so wrong as  to  make\t it\n       necessary   for\tthe  High  Court  to  interfere\t with\this\n       discretion.

The plaintiffs, resident in  Lyallpur,\nwere the government nominees, The\n403\ndefendant  company,  with  its head office at  Delhi  had  a\nbranch\toffice\tand  mills at  Lyallpur,  and  supplied\t the\nplaintiffs  with cloth from time to time in accordance\twith\nthe government quota through its branch manager at Lyallpur.\nTheir dealings lasted some 4 or 5 years prior to 1947.\nIn  accordance\twith their contract the\t plaintiffs  left  a\nsecurity  deposit of Rs. 1,000 with the\t defendant's  branch\nmanager\t at  Lyallpur, and deposited further sums  of  money\nwith  him  from\t time to time at  Lyallpur.   The  defendant\nsupplied  the plaintiffs with their quota of  cloth  against\nthose  deposits.  There was thus a running  account  between\nthe  parties  in  which the balance  was  sometimes  in\t the\nplaintiffs' favour and sometimes against them; when against,\nthey  paid the defendant interest on the  \"overdraft\".\t The\ngoods  had  to be supplied at Lyallpur and all\tmoneys\twere\npaid  there.   The  accounts were kept\tat  Lyallpur  though\ncopies were sent to the defendant's head office at Delhi.\nIn  1947, when India was partitioned, Lyallpur was  assigned\nto Pakistan.  The plaintiffs thereupon fled the country\t and\nentered India as refugees.  They settled in -Delhi and\tthus\nbecame\t\"evacuees\"  according to a Pakistan  ordinance.\t  At\nthat  time  there  was a balance of Rs.\t 11,496-6-6  in\t the\nplaintiffs' favour.  They accordingly made a demand at Delhi\nfor  payment  of this sum and for return of  their  security\ndeposit.\nIn the meanwhile the Pakistan Government issued an ordinance\n(1) vesting all evacuee property in the Custodian of Evacuee\nProperty  in Pakistan (2) prohibiting the 'payment of  money\nto  evacuees;  and (3) requiring all moneys payable  to,  or\nclaimable by, evacuees to be paid to the Deputy Custodian of\nEvacuee\t Property  in Pakistan.\t Payments so  made  were  to\noperate as a discharge from further liability to the  extent\nof  the\t payment.  Breach of this law was punishable  as  an\noffence.\nThe Deputy Custodian demanded payment from the defendant  of\nthe   moneys   owing   to   the\t  plaintiff.\tAfter\tsome\ncorrespondence and demur, the payment was made as  required.\nThe defendant pleaded this as a defence to the action.\nHeld:\t  (1)  Lyallpur was the place of primary  obligation\nbecause\t under\tthe contract the balance  remaining  at\t its\ntermination  was  to  be  paid\tthere  and  not\t  elsewhere,\naccordingly  the demand for payment made at Delhi  before  a\ndemand and refusal at Lyallpur was ineffective;\n(2)  That  the\telements out of which the  contract  to\t pay\narose were most densely grouped at Lyallpur, so Lyallpur was\nthe natural seat of the contract and the place with which it\nhad its closest and most real connection.  Accordingly,\t the\n\"proper law of the contract\" was the Lyallpur Law;\n(3)  Under  the English doctrine also the situs of the\tdebt\nwas Lyallpur; and so\n404\n(4)  either way, the Lyallpur law applied\n(5)  as it obtained at Lyallpur at the time when performance\n was  due  because a \" proper law\" intended as\ta  whole  to\ngovern a contract is administered as a \"living and  changing\nbody  of law\", accordingly, effect is given to\tany  changes\noccurring in it before performance is due;\n(6)  a\t\"debt\" being a chose in action is \"property\"  within\nthe meaning of the Pakistan Ordinance and so,\n(7)  the money was rightly paid to the Deputy Custodian\t and\nthat  operated\tas  a  good  discharge\tand  exonerated\t the\ndefendant from further liability.\nBut quaere, whether different conditions would not arise  in\na  case\t where no payment is made and the defendant  has  no\ngarnishable assets in Pakistan out of which the West  Punjab\nGovernment  could  realise the debt out of  the\t defendant's\nproperty there.\n(8)The provisions of the Pakistan ordinance relevant to the\ncase  are not opposed to the public policy of India  and  so\ncan be relied on as a defence to an action of this nature.\n Appeal allowed.\nMount  Albert  Borough Council v.

The Election Petition,\nunder Section 80 of the Representation of the People Act  of\n1951,  was admittedly time-barred by one day.  The  Election\nCommission  condoned the delay under the proviso to  Section\n85  of the Act and constituted a Tribunal for the  trial  of\nthe petition.  On pleadings of the parties, nine issues were\nframed\tby the Tribunal which are covered by  the  following\nquestions:\n(1)  Whether  the  election  petition  was  presented  by  a\nproperly authorised person.\n(2)  Whether there was sufficient cause for presentation  of\nthe\npetition  one day out of time.\n(3)  Whether  the petition was defective for non-joinder  of\ncertain parties as respondents.\n(4)  Whether  the petition was defective for want of  proper\nverification.\n(5)  Whether,the petition was defective for vagueness of the\nparticulars  relating  to the corrupt practices set  out  in\nSchedule A thereto.\nThe  Tribunal  found only the first of the above  points  in\nfavour of the petitioners by a majority.  But in respect  of\nthe  other  four  points, it held  against  the\t petitioners\nunanimously.   As a result of the adverse findings on  these\nfour points, the petition was dismissed without any trial on\nthe   merits.\tIt  is\tagainst\t this  dismissal  that\t the\nappellants  have  now  come up to this\tCourt  on  obtaining\nspecial leave.\nWhen  the  delay  in  submitting  an  election\tpetition  is\ncondoned\n\t\t\t    429\nby  the Election Commission in exercise of its\tpower  under\nthe  proviso  to  Section 85 of the  Representation  of\t the\nPeople\tAct  (Act  XLIII of 1951), it is  not  open  to\t the\nElection  Tribunal,  under  Section 90(4)  of  the  Act,  to\nreconsider  the question of limitation.\t Even if,  according\nto  the requirement of Section 82 of the  Representation  of\nthe People Act, any of the necessary parties other than\t the\nreturned  candidate has not been impleaded, the petition  is\nnot liable to be dismissed in limin on that sole ground; but\nit  is\ta  matter  to be taken\tinto  consideration  at\t the\nappropriate stage with reference to the final result of\t the\ncase.\nSection 83(1) of the Act provides that an election  petition\nhas  to be verified in the manner provided for\tverification\nof pleadings under the Code of Civil Procedure.\t Clauses (2)\nand  (3)  of rule 15 in Order VI of the Code  lay  down\t the\nprocedure  for verification of pleadings.  Apart from  those\ncases  where the date of the pleading and  the\tverification\nmay be relevant and important, it would be a wrong  exercise\nof discretionary power to dismiss an application on the sole\nground of the absence of the date of verification.  In\tsuch\na  case\t the  applicant should normally be  called  upon  to\nremove\tthe  lacuna by adding a\t supplementary\tverification\nindicating  the\t date of the original verification  and\t the\nreason for the earlier omission.\nThe  requirement of \"full particulars\" of corrupt  practices\nin  Section  83(2)  of the Act, is one that has\t got  to  be\ncomplied  with, with sufficient fullness and  clarification,\nso  as to enable the opposite party to meet the\t allegations\nagainst\t him fairly, and so as to prevent the  enquiry\tfrom\nbeing  turned into a rambling and roving  inquisition.\t The\nprimary\t responsibility for furnishing full  particulars  of\nalleged currupt practices and for filing a petition in\tfull\ncompliance  with  Section 83 (2) of the Act is that  of\t the\npetitioners.   If they fail to do so initially it  is  their\nduty   and  responsibility  to\tremove\tthe   defects\twhen\nopportunity  is available.  Tribunals, however,\t should\t not\ntake  an  all too narrow view of their function\t in  dealing\nwith the various alleged defects in the petition and dismiss\nit  on the ground of want of particulars.  They should\tcall\nfor  better particulars and if that order was  not  complied\nwith strike out such of the charges as are vague.\nThe petitioners also alleged that the returned candidate was\ndisqualified  to stand because he had interest in  contracts\nwith  the  Government.\t But  the  Tribunal  ignored   these\nallegations and without enquiring into their truth dismissed\nthe petition on the ground that the allegations relating  to\nthe charge of corrupt practices were vague,\nHeld that it was not in the interest of purity of  elections\nthat such allegations of disqualification should be  ignored\nand that it was a matter which called for enquiry.\n Case remitted for enquiry with reference to the allegations\nthat the returned candidate was disqualified and the  charge\nof corrupt practice, which was held to be not vague.\nDinabandhu v.

These five are petitions by five individuals who are now under detention for the issue of a writ in the nature of 'habeas corpus' in respect of each of them. The orders of detention in question were issued by the District Magistrate of Saran on 17-10-1954, and the Government passed further orders under Section 3 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (Act IV of 1950) on 27-10-1954, approving the detention orders passed by the District Magistrate.\nThese orders were confirmed later by the Government, on 5-1-1955, presumably after die consideration thereof by the Advisory Board and the detention in respect of each was directed to be continued until 17-10-1955. The grounds of detention in all these cases arise out of the same set of facts and are more or less similar, if not the same.\nThe validity of the detention in each of the cases is attacked on the same grounds and there has been only one single argument in respect of all these petitions. Hence they are dealt with by this common order.\n2. One argument of a general nature relating to all these matters arises with reference to the facts set out in paras. 1 to 10 in each of these petitions, the substance of which is as follows. In respect of an alleged disobedience of a prohibitory order banning processions in the town of Siwan on 9-10-1954, i.e. the Dasara day, and for alleged rioting arising out of the said disobedience, there was launched on 10-10-1954, a criminal prosecution against these five petitioners and some others under Sections 143, 145, 147 and 352 of the Penal Code.\nOn 11-10-1954, a proceeding under Section 107 of the Criminal P. C. was also started against them in view of the alleged disturbances of the 9th October. While these two proceedings were in the initial stages the Government passed the preventive detention orders now under challenge with reference to the same facts as against the present five petitioners and thereafter withdrew the above two criminal proceedings only as against them, while proceeding with the same in respect of the others.\nThe contention raised is that a detention order pased under these circumstances is an interference with the normal course of justice and is 'ipso facto mala fide' and has got to be quashed on this very ground. Observations of this Court and of some of the High Courts in similar cases have been brought to my notice which suggest that where the grounds on which a detention order is based are also the subject matter of a criminal prosecution, the order of detention may amount to abuse of the statutory powers.\nBut no case has laid down, so far, that such an order is necessarily 'mala fide'. Courts have treated such a circumstance as calling for scrutiny as to the 'bona fides' of the detention order but have held that the question of 'mala fides' has got to be decided as one of fact with reference to all the circumstances of an individual case. It is unnecessary, however, in these cases to base the decision on any such view.\nIn a proper case that question may have to be dealt with fully by this Court.\nBut here, as has been pointed out in the judgment of the High Court and in the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the State, the grounds of detention are not wholly the same as the facts in respect of which the prosecution was launched and the proceeding under Section 107 of the Criminal P. C. was initiated.\nThere are at least four items in the grounds of detention which are not the subject-matter of the prosecution, for instance grounds Nos. 4, 5, 11 and 17. In these circumstances the contention that the detentions are in respect of the very same matters for which the prosecutions were launched and that the detention orders are in the nature of interference with the course of justice and therefore 'mala fide' is not sustainable.\n3. The next argument that has been urged before me is that ground No. 17 which is as follows is on the face of it unsupportable.\n\"Due to the above enumerated actions of his, communal situation in Siwan town and also its neighbourhood namely, Benusar, Amlori, Pachrukhi, Harihans, Ratharua, Hathuari, Andor and Maharajganj deteriorated so much so that the communal situation became very explosive and serious communal conflagration resulting in wide spread riots became imminent on the evening of 24-9-1954.\nThis could only be averted with the great difficulties by the authorities and after a deployment of considerable armed, unarmed, and mounted police force in the town and the Muffasil requisitioned from Chapra, Patna, Muzzafarpur and Arrah.\"\nTo appreciate this argument it is necessary to notice   that  grounds   Nos.  1 to 16   refer to various instances dated   19-9-1954, 20-9-1954, 22-9-1954,   24-9-1954,   29-9-1954,   6-10-1954, 9-10-1954 and 10-10-1954.   It is pointed out that the statement\n \"Due to 'the above enumerated' actions of his, the communal situation in Siwan town ......... deteriorated ......... resulting in wide spread riots became imminent on the evening of 24-9-1954 which could only be averted with difficulty by deployment of considerable armed police\".\nis patently erroneous since the incidents on and after 25-9-1954 could not possibly have any bearing on the situation a day prior there to, viz. 24-9-1954. It is said, therefore, that ground No. 17 is a totally irrelevant and un sustainable ground and that this feature vitiates the entire order. Reliance is placed on -- 'Dr. Ram Krishan Bhardwaj v. State of Delhi',  .\nThe language of ground No. 17 set out above certainly does give scope for this comment and argument, and it is extremely regrettable that in so important a matter as detention of a citizen without trial, such mistakes are allowed to occur suggesting absence of careful scrutiny by the authority concerned.\nA perusal, however, of the various grounds arid a reading of para 17 in the light thereof would reasonably indicate that what is stated in para 17 as being the situation by the evening of 24-9-1954, is to be related to the actions enumerated in paras 1 to 6 and not to) those in paras 7 to 16 and that the phrasa \"above enumerated\" is not necessarily to be related to all the \"above\" but only to some out of them.\nAt best it may be said that loose language has been used. Quite apart from this, however, paragraph 17 'purports to do nothing more than to state a fact, viz.\n \"that the communal situation became explosive and serious communal conflagration resulting in wide-spread riots became imminent by the evening of the 24th September, 1954.\"\nThis is a statement of fact on which, along with the facts in paras 1 to 16, the decision of the Government to detain the petitioners is based. Even assuming that there is some mistake in the enumeration of what events lead to the communal situation, the truth or otherwise of the assertion that there was in fact a communal situation of an explosive nature by the evening of 24-9-1954, is one that cannot be gone into in this Court.\nI do not see, therefore, how the case in , can be made to apply to the facts of this case.\n4. The next argument is that some of the grounds are vague, for instance ground No. 5 and that, therefore, the principle in , applies to these cases. I have considered carefully all the grounds. I do not find any such vagueness as would handicap the detenu in making proper representation to the Advisory Board.\nIndeed the grounds furnished to the detenus in these cases are very elaborate and fairly exhaustive. The obligation of the Government to furnish grounds which are not vague cannot be taken to mean that they must furnish every meticulous detail. I am satisfied that the detenus in these cases could have no grievance against the detention orders on the ground of vagueness of any one of the grounds therein.\n5. None of the arguments addressed to me challenging the validity of the orders of detention are sustainable. These applications were accordingly liable to be dismissed and have accordingly, been dismissed by my orders pronounced in Court on 12-8-1955.\n"}, {"id": "506242", "date": "9/1955", "tagline": "M/S.

The  bans  imposed  by  Article\t286  of\t the\nConstitution  on  the  taxing  powers  of  the\tStates\t are\nindependent and separate and each one of them has to be\t got\nover   before  a  State\t Legislature  can  impose   tax\t  on\ntransactions of sale or purchase of goods.  The\t Explanation\nto Article 286(1)(a) determines by the legal fiction created\ntherein\t the situs of the sale in the case  of\ttransactions\ncoming within that category and once it is determined by the\napplication of the Explanation that a transaction is outside\nthe  State it follows as a matter of course that the  State,\nwith  reference\t to  which  the\t transaction  can  thus\t  be\npredicated to be outside it, can never tax the transaction.\n    The\t  ban\tunder  Article\t286(1)(a)  read\t  with\t the\nExplanation is effective independently of the fact that\t the\ntransaction  may  have taken place in the course  of  inter-\nState  trade or commerce or with reference to goods as\thave\nbeen  declared by Parliament by law to be essential for\t the\nlife of the community.\tThe ban imposed under Article 286(2)\nis  an\tindependent  and  separate  one\t and  looks  at\t the\ntransactions entirely from the point of view of their having\ntaken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.,\nEven if such transactions may also fall within the  category\nof  transactions  covered  by  Article\t286(1)(a)  and\t the\nExplanation  thereto  or Article 286(3) the  moment  Article\n286(2)\tis attracted by reason of the transactions being  in\nthe  course of inter-State trade or commerce, the ban  under\nArticle\t 286(2) operates and such transactions can never  be\nsubjected  to  tax at the instance of  a  State\t Legislature\nexcept in so far as Parliament by law may otherwise  provide\nor such power of taxation is saved by the President's  order\ncontemplated  in the proviso.  The ban under Article  286(2)\nmay  be\t saved by the President's order but  that  does\t not\naffect or lift the ban under Article 286(1)(a) read with the\nExplanation.\n   Apart  from\tthe  aforesaid\tconstruction  put  upon\t the\nseveral\t clauses of Article 286 in The Bengal  Immunity\t Co.\ncase the terms of the proviso to Article 286(2) itself\tmake\nit  abundantly clear that the proviso is meant only to\tlift\nthe ban under Article 286(2) and no other.  It is a cardinal\nrule  of  interpretation  that\ta  proviso  carves  out\t  an\nexception to the main provision to which it is enacted as  a\nproviso and to no other.  This is made further clear by\t the\nnonobstante clause which states in express terms that it  is\nenacted\t only with reference to \"this clause\"  i.e.  Article\n286(2).\nThe  proviso  cannot  be  extended  to\tany  of\t the   other\nprovisions  of\tArticle 286 and it has. therefore,  not\t the\neffect\tof  lifting  the ban which  is\timposed\t by  Article\n286(1)(a) and the Explanation thereto.\n  Therefore,  so  far  as the  post-Constitution  period  is\nconcerned  the\tban  imposed by Article\t 286(1)(a)  and\t the\nExplanation thereto could not be removed by the\t President's\norder  which was issued under the proviso to Article  286(2)\nin the present case.\n  Explanation  11 to Section 2(g) of the  Central  Provinces\nand  Berar  Sales Tax Act, 1947 offended  Article  286(1)(a)\n-road with the\n\t\t\t    485\nExplanation to the same and the State of Madhya Pradesh\t was\ntherefore,  not entitled to tax the transactions of sale  in\nwhich  goods had actually been delivered as a direct  result\nof  such  sale for purposes of\tconsumption  outside  Madhya\nPradesh\t and the said Explanation was riot protected by\t the\nPresident's  order  issued  under  the\tproviso\t to  Article\n286(2).\n   Where an assessment consists of a single undivided sum in\nrespect\t  of  the  totality  of\t the  property\ttreated\t  as\nassessable, the wrongful inclusion in it of certain items of\nproperty  which\t by  virtue  of\t a  provision  of  law\twere\nexpressly  exempted  from taxation, renders  the  assessment\ninvalid in toto.\nBennett\t &  White (Calgary) Ltd. and Municipal\tDistrict  of\nSugar City No. 5 (1951 Appeal Cases 786 at p. 816), referred\nto.\nJAGANNADHADAS  J.

This is an appeal by special leave from a judgment and order of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dated the 31-3-1953 allowing the appeal of the State of Uttar Pradesh against the order of acquittal passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Meerut dated the 25-5-1951, so far as the appellant was concerned. The appellant and another person named Hoshiara had both been placed on trial for an offence under Section 302, Penal Code read with Section 34, Penal Code. Both had been acquitted by the learned trial Judge.\nBut the State of Uttar Pradesh preferred an appeal only as against the appellant, The appellant has been convicted under that section and sentenced to transportation for life.\n2. The charge against the appellant, as also against the co-accused was that on the night between the 3rd and 4th June 1950 in village Tavela Garhi, P. O. Binauli, sub-district Sardhana, district Meerut, he had murdered Smt. Shivdevi in the latter's 'gher' and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 302, Indian Penal Code. The first information report had been lodged by Sub-Inspector Bishram Singh to the effect that he along with head constable Ram Bahadur Singh and constable Bhagat Singh of the Provincial Armed Constabulary who were with a platoon camping outside with a view to prevention of serious crimes, while on their round stopped in front of the appellant's 'gher' (which may freely be translated as a farmhouse)   on hearing   a sound which raised their suspicion.\nSoon after that Asaram Kahar (P. W. 1) came running from the direction of the police camp which was just outside the village. He informed the police party that he and his wife had heard from the roof of their house the shrieks of a woman from inside the appellant's 'gher' and that he had gone to the police camp to report the matter. The first informant called out the name of Atley repeatedly from outside as the main door had been bolted from inside. As there was no response, he called Sajawal, chowkidar and sent him along with \"constable Bhagat Singh and Asaram aforesaid inside the 'gher' by scaling over the low wall to see what the matter was.\nGuards were posted all round the house. They found the appellant lying on a bed with his face covered with a cloth. The appellant was brought out of the house and on being questioned by the Sub-Inspector, began to tremble and with folded hands begged pardon. The suspicion of the police party was further roused by the conduct of the appellant. They were inside the 'gher' and on search being made of the premises, made the gruesome discovery of a corpse, which was later identified to be that of the appellant's wife, stuffed in a sack. The appellant is said to have made a self-incriminating statement' as a result of which he was taken into custody and information sent to the police station.\nP. W. 15, the second officer of the police station Binauli, left for the spot eight or nine miles distant from the police station and reaching there about 10 A.M. started the investigation. He found the dead body of Shivdevi in a gunny bag in the 'kotha' inside the appellant's 'gher'. He noticed a piece of cloth (orhna) in the mouth of the dead body. He found the petticoat of a female inside the 'kotha'. He also found marks of strangulation on the neck of the deceased. The dead body was naked. That day and on the following day, i.e., 5-6-1950, he examined the persons who figured later as P. Ws. 1 to 9 and 11 to 14.\nThe Civil Surgeon of Meerut held the post-mortem examination of the dead body on the 5th June at 6-15 P.M. The body was bloated all over, in a highly advanced state of decomposition with the skin peeling off, both eyes were bulging and there was bloody discharge from both nostrils and the tongue was protruding out. No external mark of injury could be located due to the bloating and the advanced state of decomposition. On opening up the body, it was found that on the right side the second to fifth ribs and on the left side the second to sixth ribs, had been broken and the sternum was also fractured.\nDeath in the opinion of the doctor was due to \"compression of the chest which resulted in the fracture of the sternum and ribs and shock and haemorrhage.\" After completion of the investigation and the preliminary enquiry by the committing magistrate the appellant along with Hoshiara was placed on trial with the result indicated above.\n3. At the trial a number of witnesses, namely, P. Ws. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were examined to prove that these next door neighbours at dead of night heard the shrieks of Shivdevi and they inferred that she was being severely beaten. On hearing her cry, P. W. 1, Asaram, as indicated above, hurried to the P. A. C. camp to inform the police party. P. W. 2, Bishram Singh, Sub-Inspector, happened to reach the same spot from the opposite direction on his round and he also suspected that something nefarious was happening inside the appellant's 'gher'.\nThe other P. Ws. then described how they entered the 'gher' and discovered the dead body of Shivdevi in circumstances leading them to infer that it was the appellant who was the perpetrator of the crime.\n4. The defence of the appellant as disclosed in his examination under Section 342, Criminal Procedure Code, in the Sessions Court was that he had not taken Shivdevi from his residential house to the 'gher' that fateful night between the 3rd and 4th June, 1950. To further questions by the court he answered as follows :\n\"I did not kill her nor was Hoshiara with me. I was not at the 'gher' and was not lying on the cot as alleged. I was not at all at my 'gher' till that time. Asa and Mangat sepoy had come to my Persian wheel in the field and they took me with them to the military officer that night. When I was brought to him from the jungle no recovery of the dead body took place in my presence.\" It would thus appear that the appellant completely denied his presence at any time of that night at the 'gher'. If it were true that he was nowhere near his 'gher' that night and that as alleged by him he had been working with his Persian wheel in his field and that he was brought to his 'gher' from his field by the police officers, all the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution has undoubtedly failed to connect him with the crime. The learned Additional Sessions Judge appears to have accepted the defence of the appellant as would appear from the following significant passage in his judgment :\n\"The fact of murder is not disputed but it is seriously disputed that Atley was present in the gher' when people entered the 'gher' where after the dead body was recovered from the 'kotha'. I am referred to the statement of P.W. Raja Ram, the Mukhia and sarpanch of the village who pays Rs. 100 as land revenue. He was sent for to Atley's 'gher' by the military police. According to him when he reached that 'gher' Atley was under the custody of the military police and standing in the public path in front of the door of the 'gher'.\nIt is clear from his statement that Atley was arrested first and the entry into his 'gher' was effected thereafter\".\nThe learned trial Judge jumped to this con-conclusion relying upon the following statement in the cross-examination of Raja Ram, P.W. 11, who was a sarpanch and had been called by Sajawal, chowkidar, to the appellant's 'gher':\n \"Atley accused was in custody and standing in the public path in front of the door of the 'gher'. Nobody talked to Atley in my presence\".\nThese are the opening sentences in the short cross-examination of Raja Ram, P.W. 11. It is clear that the cross-examination lawyer obtained those statements in that bald form without any reference to sequence of events. It is also clear from the statements in examination-in-chief of this witness that he was making those statements without any regard to the sequence of time in which the events deposed to by him occurred. The learned trial Judge appears to have been misled by his reading too much into the statements of that witness made in cross-examination.\nOnce that crucial mistake had been made and the substantive defence of the accused accepted, the learned Judge did not find much difficulty in brushing aside the other evidence in the case. The judgment of the learned trial Judge is a recital seriatim of the evidence of each witness in separate paragraphs and at the very threshold of his observations on that evidence he makes the blunder of attributing a sequence to the statements of P.W. 11, Raja Ram, which his evidence, if read properly, does not justify.\nThe learned Judges of the High Court therefore were right in pointing out that the learned trial Judge had misdirected himself in holding that the evidence led by the prosecution, particularly of Asaram and Sub-Inspector Bishram Singh, had in any way been shaken by the aforesaid statements of P.W. 11. The High Court also points out that the examination-in-chief itself by the prosecuting lawyer had not been properly done inasmuch as no attempt had been made to bring out statements in their chronological sequence.\nThe High Court after a very thorough and exhaustive examination of the evidence in the case came to the conclusion that the appellant was found inside the 'gher' as alleged by the prosecution and that the circumstances disclosed in the evidence pointed to the conclusion that the appellant was responsible for the murder, probably aided by another person. The High Court did not examine closely the part said to have been played by Hoshiara as the State Government had not filed any appeal against him. But the learned Judges of the High Court had no doubt that so far as the appellant was concerned, the guilt for the crime had been brought home to him.\n5. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the judgment of the trial court being one of acquittal, the High Court should not have set it aside on mere appreciation of the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution unless it came to the conclusion that the judgment of the trial Judge was perverse. In Our opinion, it is not correct to say that unless the appellate court in an appeal under Section 417, Criminal P. C. came to the conclusion that the judgment of acquittal under appeal was perverse it could not set aside that order.\nIt has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High Court on an appeal against an order of acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, of course, keeping in view the well established rule that the presumption of innocence of the accused is not weakened but strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court which had the advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses whose evidence have been recorded in its presence.\nIt is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers of appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of acquittal as in the case of an appeal against an order of conviction, subject to the riders that the presumption of innocence with which the accused person starts in the trial court continues even up to the appellate stage and that the appellate court should attach due weight to the opinion of the trial court which recorded the order of acquittal.\nIf the appellate court reviews the evidence, keeping those principles in mind, and comes to a contrary conclusion, the judgment cannot be said to have been vitiated. (See in this connection the very cases cited at the Bar, namely, 'Surajpal Singh v. The State', ; Wilayat Khan v. State of Uttar Pradesh' . In our opinion, there is no substance in the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the High Court was not justified in reviewing the entire evidence and coming to its own conclusions.\n6. The other contentions raised on behalf of the appellant need no serious consideration because they relate to mere appreciation of evidence and do not raise any question of principle. For example, it was said that the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution did not clearly establish the motive for the crime. It was said that it was true that the deceased was the discarded wife of the appellant who had taken a second wife but that there was no clear evidence of any serious quarrels between the husband and the wife.\nThat is true; and where there is clear proof of motive for the crime, that lends additional support to the finding of the court that the accused was guilty but the absence of clear proof of motive does not necessarily lead to the contrary conclusion. If the prosecution had proved by clear evidence that the appellant had reasons of his own for getting his first wife out of the way, that would have lent additional assurance to the circumstantial evidence pointing to his guilt. But the fact that the prosecution has failed to lead such evidence has this effect only, that the other evidence bearing on the guilt of the accused has to be very closely examined.\nIn this case the learned Judges of the High Court have very carefully examined the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution and come to the conclusion that the circumstances proved beyond any doubt that the appellant was responsible for the murder that night. It may be that he was aided by Hoshiara but that was a matter on which the court was not called upon to finally pronounce its opinion. If the conclusion was right, there is no doubt that the appellant deserved the only sentence that under the law could be imposed upon him apart from the extreme penalty which the High Court in this case did not think fit to impose.\n7. In our opinion, no ground has been made out for interference. The  appeal is accordingly dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "811142", "date": "9/1955", "tagline": "Machander, Son Of Pandurang vs State Of Hyderabad on 27 September, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nMACHANDER, SON OF PANDURANG\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nSTATE OF HYDERABAD.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n27/09/1955\n\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\n\nCITATION:\n 1955 AIR  792\t\t  1955 SCR  (2) 524\n\n\nACT:\nExamination  of the accused-Duty of trial  court-Failure  to\nexamine accused on material points-Effect-Acquittal-Code  of\nCriminal Procedure (Act V of 1898), s. 342.\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\n  The  appellant  was  put up on his trial on  a  charge  of\nmurder.\t  The trial continued for 41/2 years.\tHis  brother\nwho  was a co-accused absconded.

The appellant was one of several candidates who stood for election to the Legislative Assembly of the State of Mysore from the Tarikera Constituency. At the polling which took place on 4-1-1952 he obtained 8093 votes as against 8059 got by the first respondent, the others getting much less, & was duly declared elected. The first respondent then filed a petition for getting aside the election on the ground that the appellant had committed corrupt and illegal practices, and also prayed that he might himself be declared duly elected.\nBy its order dated 15-1-1953, the Election Tribunal, Shimoga held that three of the corrupt practices set out in the petition had been proved, viz., (1) that one Ahmed Jan had with the connivance of the appellant transported voters to the polling booth in a service bus free of fare, (2) that the appellant secured the services of a Government servant, Parameswarappa to canvass for him at the election, and (3) that the return of election expenses made by him was false, and that the amount actually spent for the election exceeded the maximum allowed.\n2. On these findings, the Tribunal declared the election of the appellant void, and further recorded a finding under Section 99 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 that he had committed the corrupt practices mentioned in Sections 123(6) and (8) and Section 124 (4), and had thereby become subject to the disqualifications referred to in Sections 140 and 143 of the Act. It further held that the first respondent had secured the largest number of valid votes, and declared him duly elected.\nThe appellant moved the High Court of Mysore under Article 226 for a writ of 'certiorari to quash the decision of the Tribunal, and by their judgment dated 11-1-1954 the learned Judges set it aside on the ground that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction in permitting certain amendments, and also that there were errors apparent on the face of the record. The first respondent then preferred an appeal to this Court, and by its judgment dated 5-5-1954 this Court set aside the order of the High Court on the ground that the order of the Tribunal was not bad either for want of jurisdiction, or for any error apparent on the face of the record, and in the result, the order of the Tribunal dated 15-1-1953 stood restored. Vide -- 'T. C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa', .\n3. The appellant has now come up to this Court by way of special appeal against the order of the Tribunal dated 15-1-1953, and has urged the following grounds:\n(1) The findings that the appellant had committed the corrupt practices mentioned in Sections 123(6) and (8) and Section 124 (4) are not justified by the evidence;\n(2) The Tribunal was in error in declaring the first respondent herein duly elected; and\n \n\n(3) The Tribunal had acted illegally in recording a finding against the appellant that he had become disqualified under Sections 140 and 143 without notice to him under the proviso to Section 99.\n4. As regards the first contention, this Court has repeatedly held that ordinarily it will not in special appeal review findings of fact recorded by an Election Tribunal if there is evidence on which they could be reached. The appellant is unable to say that there is no evidence whatsoever in support of these findings, and we must therefore decline to interfere with them.\n5. (2) It is next contended that having found that the appellant was guilty of corrupt practices, the Tribunal should have stopped with declaring his election void, and should not have passed the further order under Section 101 (b) declaring the first respondent duly elected. What the Tribunal has done is this: It found that, about 60 voters were transported by Ahmed Jan to the polling booth, that of them 47 were Muslim women who Voted for the appellant, and that if their votes were struck out, the margin of difference between the appellant and the first respondent which was only 34 votes would disappear, and the first respondent would have secured the largest number of valid votes.\nThis is in accordance with Section 101(b) which enacts that if the Tribunal is of opinion that but for the votes obtained by the returned candidate by corrupt or illegal practices, the petitioner would have obtained a majority of the valid votes, it could declare him duly elected. It is argued for the appellant that it cannot be said with certainty that the 47 votes recorded by the Muslim women would not have been recorded in favour of the appellant if corrupt practice had not been committed, that it would be mere speculation to hold that they would not be, and that therefore there is no legal basis for the finding that the first respondent got the majority of votes.\n6. In support of this contention, reliance is placed on the observations of this Court in Jamuna Prasad v. Lachhi Ram  that \"there is nothing to show why the majority of the first respondent's voters would have preferred the 6th respondent and ignored the 3rd and 4th respondents.\" There, the Court was considering the question, to which of the defeated candidates the votes obtained by the returned candidate by corrupt and illegal practices would have been given, and it held that it would be mere speculation to hold that they would have been given to the candidate next in the order of votes and not to the others, and as there was no certainty about the number of the votes, there was no basis on which the next candidate could be declared elected.\nBut, in the present case, the finding is that in all, 60 votes were recorded by the electors who were transported by Ahmed Jan, and of them at least 47 were recorded for the returned candidate. There is also the further finding that the voters would not have come to the polling booth from their village which was at a long distance but for the facilities furnished by Ahmed Jan. Even if all these votes were recorded in favour of the defeated candidate other than the first respondent, the lead of the latter would remain unaffected. On these facts, therefore, the observations in  have no application. The contention of the appellant, moreover, is not that these votes might have turned the scale in favour of any of the defeated candidates other than the first respondent but in favour of himself. This is contrary to what is provided in Section 101(b) of the Act, and there is nothing in  to support it. We must also observe that this question is really concluded by the observation of this Court in  that,\n \"If the votes of at least 40 or 50 of these persons be left out of account as being procured by corrupt practice of the first respondent, the latter's majority by 34 votes would be completely wiped out and the petitioner (present 1st respondent) would gain an undisputed majority\".\nNo other argument is urged in support of this contention, which must accordingly be rejected.\n7.  (3) It was finally argued that the finding of the Tribunal that the appellant had become subject to the disqualifications mentioned in Sections 140 and 143 was bad, because no notice was given to him as required by the proviso to Section 99. We have held in 'Civil Appeal No. 21 of 1955 (SC) (C)' that no fresh notice under the proviso need be given to a party to the election petition in respect of the very charges which are the subject-matter of enquiry therein and as to which he already had notice.\nThe corrupt practices which have been found to entail the disqualifications under Sections 140 and 143 are the very matters which formed the subject-matter of the election petition, and as the appellant had already had ample opportunity to defend himself against those charges, there was no need for a further notice to him under the proviso. We have also held in the said appeal that in making recommendations  with reference to the disqualifications mentioned in Sections 141 to 143, the Tribunal exercises an advisory jurisdiction, and the proviso has no application to it. Following this decision, we must overrule this contention.\n8. In the result, the appeal fails a nd is dismissed with costs.\n"}, {"id": "44840", "date": "9/1955", "tagline": "Nathu vs State Of Uttar Pradesh on 21 September, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

On 17-5-1952 Sri Nand Lal Kureel, the City Magistrate of Manipuri, returned home from court at about 5 p. m. and found his son, Sumer Singh, aged about 10 or 11 years, missing. After some fruitless search, he e-ported the matter to the police. On information given later that night by P. W. 26, Sri Kureel sent for Bhola, the first accused, who stated that he and the second accused, Ram Singh, had in the course of the day lured away the boy. The second accused was then sent for, and he also made a similar statement. Thereupon, Sri Kureel handed them over to the police for further investigation.\nAt about 3 a. m. on the same night, Bhola and Ram Singh took the police, Sri Kureel & some others to an outlying garden, and at their instance, the dead body of Sumer Singh was discovered in a well in that garden. The post-mortem examination showed that death was due to asphyxia. Both the courts below have held that it was not a case of accidental drowning but of murder by strangulation; and that finding has not been disputed. The only question is, who perpetrated the crime?\n2. Accused 1 and 2 were in the lock-up until 22nd May, when they were taken into jail custody. On the 24th, both of them made confessional statements (Exhibits P-5 and P-6) before a Special First-class Magistrate, P. W. 28. These confessions, though subsequently retracted, have been found by both the courts to have been true and voluntary, and it was on the strength of these confessions which received corroboration in material particulars from the evidence in the case, that accused 1 and 2 were convicted.\nIn the confessional statements, accused 1 and 2 stated that on the day previous to the occurrence, the appellant told them to bring the deceased and promised to pay Rs. 5 each, that accordingly on 17-5-1952 they enticed the boy away to an outlying garden stating that they might eat mangoes, that while they were in the garden the appellant came there, tied an 'angochha' round the neck of the deceased and strangled him, themselves holding the deceased by the hands and feet, and that they then threw him into the well.\nThese statements have been relied on in support of the conviction of the appellant, and one of the contentions urged on his behalf is that they are inadmissible in evidence, and that the conviction based thereon is illegal. This question will be considered in due course.\n3. The appellant, as appears from the evidence of Sri Kureel, which has been accepted by both the courts, was arrested on the night between 20th and 21st May. Though the confessional statements of accused 1 and 2 were recorded on the 24th May, seeing that they were in police custody from the night of the 17th down to the 22nd it may be presumed that the appellant was arrested on the night of the 20th as the result of statements made by accused 1 and 2.\nThe police, however, released the appellant immediately, and it was not till 8-6-1952 that he was re-arrested. If is certainly remarkable that the police should have released the appellant immediately after his arrest on the 20th without further investigation, and it is even more remarkable that no steps should have been taken to apprehend him at least after the confessions implicating him were made by accused 1 and 2 on the 24th.\nThe explanation for this conduct as found by both the courts below was that the local police were reluctant to bring the real offenders to book. To appreciate this, it must be mentioned that the fourth accused, Bagh Ali, was a head constable who had been dismissed from service, that proceedings were taken against him under Section 107, Criminal P. C., and by an order passed by Sri Kureel on 30-4-1952 he had been bound over.\nIt is in the evidence of Sri Kureel that Bagh Ali was shadowing him thereafter, and there is also the evidence of P. Ws. 21 and 22 that Bagh Ali was swearing vengeance against Sri Kureel. Sri Kureel naturally suspected the fourth accused of having had a hand in the affair, and communicated his suspicion to the police.\nThe station officer at that time was Sri Surendra Shankar Singh, P. W. 32, and it is stated that he had known the fourth accused since 1941 when the latter was a head constable at Agra and the witness a constable, and was interested in shielding him. It is suggested that P. W. 32 released the appellant on the night of the 20th, and failed to take action against him with a view to save the fourth accused. P. W. 32 denied that he arrested the appellant on the 20th, but his evidence has not been accepted.\n4. To continue the narration, when Sri Kureel discovered that P. W. 32 was not keen on investigating the matter, he complained to the Superintendent of Police, and it was thereafter that the appellant was arrested on the 8th June. From that time down to 7th August he was in jail. On that day, he was sent for interrogation to the C. I. D. Inspector, P. W. 33, who had been deputed to make the investigation. P. W. 33 held the appellant in custody till 20th August at the Krishna Talkies.\nOn the 20th, the appellant was sent back to jail custody, and on the 21st he made die confessional statement, Exhibit P-15, to P. W. 28. In this statement, he implicated the fourth accused as the prime offender. Meantime, the fourth accused had been arrested on 4-8-1952, and eventually, the four accused were committed to the Sessions Court for trial on the charge that they had murdered Sumer Singh.\nThe Sessions Judge held that the confessions of accused 1 and 2 had been sufficiently corroborated, and convicted them under Section 302, but in view of their age--they were aged 14 and 16--sentenced them to transportation for life. As regards the appellant who was the third accused, he held that his confession was corroborated by the evidence of P. Ws. 13 and 15 and by the confessions of accused 1 and 2, and accordingly convicted him under Section 302 and sentenced him to death.\nAs regards the fourth accused, he held that there was only the confession of the third accused against him, and that that was not sufficiently corroborated by the other evidence in the case. He accordingly gave him the benefit of doubt, and acquitted him. Accused 3 appealed to the High Court of Allahabad, and there was also a reference under Section 374 for confirmation of the sentence of death.\nOn a review of the evidence, the learned Judges agreed with the conclusion of the Sessions Judge, and confirmed both the conviction of the appellant and the sentence passed on him. Against this judgment, the appellant has preferred this appeal to this Court by special leave.\n5. On behalf of the appellant, it is urged that there is no reliable evidence to connect him with the offence, and that the conviction is accordingly bad. The evidence in support of the conviction consists of the confession of the appellant. Exhibit P-15, the evidence of P.Ws. 13 and 15 which has been relied on as corroborating it in material particulars and the confessions of accused 1 and 2, Exhibits P-5 and P-6.\nIt is argued by Mr. Varma for the appellant that the confession, Exhibit P-15, was not voluntary, that the evidence of P.Ws. 13 and 15 is neither reliable, nor does it sufficiently corroborate Exhibit P-15, and that the confessions of accused 1 and 2 are inadmissible as against the appellant, and should not have been acted upon.\nThe question how far the confessions of co-accused, could be treated as evidence against an accused was considered elaborately in -- 'Kashmira Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh',  and it was held therein that such statements, were not evidence as defined in Section 3 of the Evidence Act, that no conviction could be founded thereon, but that if there was other evidence on which a conviction could be based, they could be referred to as lending assurance to that conclusion and for fortifying it.\nExhibits P-5 and P-6 are, therefore, not substantive evidence, and could only be taken into consideration if there is other independent evidence on which the conviction could be based. In the present case, that evidence consists only of the confession of the appellant, Exhibit P-15.\n6. It is contended for the appellant that this confession cannot be acted upon, firstly because it is not voluntary, and secondly because there is no evidence worth the name to corroborate it. On the question whether Exhibit P-15 was voluntary, the cardinal feature to be noted is that the appellant was kept separately in the custody of the C.I.D. Inspector (P.W. 33) from the 7th August to 20th August, and the confession was recorded on the 21st August.\nIt appears to us that the prolonged custody immediately preceding the making of the confession is sufficient, unless it is properly explained, to stamp Exhibit P-15, as involuntary. P. W. 33 made no attempt to explain this unusual circumstance. It is true that with reference to this matter the appellant made various suggestions in the cross-examination of P.W. 33, such as that he was given 'bhang' and liquor, or shown pictures, or promised to be made an approver, and they have been rejected -- and rightly -- as unfounded.\nBut that does not relieve the prosecution from its duty of positively establishing that the confession was voluntary, and for that purpose, it was necessary to prove the circumstances under which this unusual step was taken. There being no such evidence, we are unable to act upon Exhibit P-15, as a voluntary confession. It was argued that better evidence was not forthcoming, as the investigation by P.W. 32 was, as already stated, half-hearted and perfunctory, and no adequate steps were taken to secure evidence before P.W. 33 took up the matter on 18-7-1952.\nAll this is true, and the result is no doubt very unfortunate; but that does not cure the defect from which Exhibit P-15 suffers. It was also argued that both the courts below had found that Exhibit P-15 was voluntary, and that that was a finding with which this Court would not interfere in special appeal. But then, the courts below have, in coming to that conclusion, failed to note that P.W. 33 has offered no explanation for keeping the appellant in separate custody from the 7th to 20th August, and that is a matter which the prosecution had to explain, if the confession made on 21-8-1952 was to be accepted as voluntary.\nIn this view, the only substantive evidence against the appellant, Exhibit P-15, falls to the ground, and in strictness, the further questions whether that has been corroborated by the evidence of P.Ws. 13 and 15, and whether Exhibits P-5 and P-6 lend assurance to it do not arise.\n7. We may, however, add that the question whether the evidence of P.Ws 13 and 15 affords sufficient corroboration to the confession of the appellant is not wholly free from doubt. The deposition of P.W. 13, as it appears in the record, is incomplete, and if true, it shows that the appellant was seen with the deceased and accused 1 and 2 near the scene of occurrence at about midday.\nP.W. 13 deposes that he gave this information to P.W. 32; but the latter does not speak to it, and he has not been asked about it. P.W. 15 also gives evidence similar to that of P.W. 13, but admits that he did mot know the deceased or accused 1 and 2.\n8. It is argued for the appellant that in view of these infirmities the evidence of P.Ws. 13 and 15 should not be accepted. There can be no doubt that their evidence, if believed, would be corroboration of Exhibit P-15 on a material point, viz., that the appellant was seen with the deceased at about the time of the occurrence near the garden, and it is also true that the question whether that should be believed is one on which this Court would not ordinarily interfere with the views of the courts below.\nBut in the view that Exhibit P-15 is not shown to be voluntary, there is no need to further discuss the question Whether if it was voluntary, the evidence of P.Ws. 13 and 15 affords , sufficient corroboration thereof.\n9. Then, there remain the confessions of accused 1 and 2, Exhibits P-5 and P-6. There being, in our view, no substantive and independent evidence on which a conviction could be based, the confessions cannot be used for sustaining the conviction, and should be left out of consideration altogether. We may also add that we are not satisfied that those statements can He regarded as lending assurance to the confession recorded in Exhibit P-15.\nOn the contrary, the difference between the two is such as to throw considerable doubt on both. While according to Exhibits P-5 and P-6 the appellant was the prime offender, according to Exhibit P-15 Bagh Ali, the fourth accused, was the moving spirit and it was he that actively intervened and spurred him on to commit the crime while he was wavering. Both these statements cannot be true, and if either of them must be untrue, the question arises as to how and why the untruth in the one or the other was brought about.\nIn this situation, we should be reluctant to hold that Exhibits P-5 and P-6 lend any assurance to the truth of the confession in Exhibit P-15. We are, therefore, of opinion that there is no reliable evidence on which the appellant could be convicted.\n10. In the result, the appeal is allowed, the conviction and sentence of the appellant are set aside,  and it is directed that he be set at liberty.\n"}, {"id": "446535", "date": "9/1955", "tagline": "Narayanan Nair Raghavan Nair vs The State Of Travancore-Cochin on 26 September, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

The appellant Raghavan has been convicted under Section 302, Indian Penal Code, for murdering one Ayyappan and has been sentenced to death. His younger brother Bhaskaran was also charged but was convicted under Section 324, Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to two years. We are not concerned with him here.\n2. There are six eye-witnesses to the murder, all of whom have been believed by both the Courts. We decline to go behind this evidence and so will proceed at once to assess the case on the basis of the facts found. They are as follows.\n3. Litigation was in progress between the appellant and his grandmother Parvathi Amma. The latter sued the appellant and his brother for partition and separate possession of her share in her son's estate, the son being the father of the appellant and his two brothers (one of whom does not figure in this case).\n4. During the course of the proceedings the grandmother Parvathi Amma assigned her interest to her daughter Parvarthy Lakshmi Amma (P.W. 10). This Parvathy (P.W. 10) is the widow of the deceased Ayyappan.\n5. After notice to the parties, Balakrishna Pillai (P.W. 5) and Thomas Kuriyan (P.W. 6), the Commissioners appointed to effect the partition, proceeded to the spot, carried out a survey and made certain measurements. While this was in progress, the two accused came on the scene and started pelting Velayudhan Nair (P.W. 1) with stones and abusing him.\nThis Velayudhan Nair is the son-in-law of the deceased Ayyappan. Some of the stones hit the witness and there are injuries on his person to bear this out. Both Courts have accepted this evidence. The only thing they have not been able to determine is which of the several stones that were thrown actually hit the witness. But the fact that the appellant and his brother started the assault by pelting Velayudhan (P.W. 1) with stones and abusing him is accepted.\n6. Velayudhan (P.W. 1) retaliated by slapping the appellant across the cheek. This resulted in a minor scuffle between the two. Krishnan Nair (P.W. 14) and the deceased came up to them, and the former (Krishnan Nair) tried to separate them while the deceased, who was Velayudhan's (P.W. 1's) father-in-law, said to his son-in-law --\n \"Velayudhan! you should not quarrel. I shall find a solution for this\".\n The appellant thereupon took a penknife from his waist and hit out at the deceased. The deceased tried to ward off the blow and was hit on the back of his left forearm. The appellant struck again and this time the blow landed on the chest and caused the injury which eventually killed the man. In the meanwhile the second accused came up and inflicted a stab wound on the deceased's back with another knife.\nThis could not have caused death though the doctor says it probably aggravated the shock from the fatal wound. Each accused has been held individually liable for the separate injuries caused by him. Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code was not called into play.\n7. The first question that we have to determine is whether this is a case of murder or one under Section 304. We are only concerned with the injury on the chest. But before proceeding to that it is necessary to say that Ayyappan did not die at once. He was carried about a mile on a cot to a waiting jeep and then driven to the hospital.\nHis dying declaration was recorded and then he was handed over to the doctor, P.W. 9, who examined him medically. The doctor thought it necessary to operate because he found that a portion of the omentum had protruded through the wound and because there was difficulty in breathing: (\"the power of controlling respiration is lost\").\nThe doctor explains that it was necessary to perform a minor operation to push the omentum back into place as that could not be done from the outside. The operation consisted of extending the wound at its outer portion so as to enable the surgeon to deal with the omentum properly. The patient died some twelve hours later.\n8. It was strenuously argued before us that the wound was not fatal in itself and that if the doctor had not stupidly interfered with the ordinary course of nature all would have been well. Counsel contended that death was due to the negligence of the doctor and not to the wound inflicted by his client.\nHe relied on the following passage in Modi's Medical Jurisprudence, 12th Edn. p. 270, and contended that Modi says that the diaphragm is not a vital organ and that injuries to it are not likely to be fatal unless some vital organ in contact with it is also injured. The passage runs--\n \"Wounds of the diaphragm are liable to be produced by penetrating wounds of the chest or of the abdomen. They are not rapidly fatal unless the important organs in contact with it are also wounded\". \nWe do not read the passage to mean that. It indicates that such injuries are likely to be fatal though not 'rapidly' so. A later passage supports this:\n \"It\" (rupture) \"gives rise to much pain on coughing or deep breathing, and may cause death from severe shock\".\n9. This is fundamentally a question of fact. Modi's book does not establish that injuries to the diaphragm cannot be fatal: some are and some are not. The question is, therefore, reduced to one of fact in each case. Was the particular injury in question of the fatal or non-fatal type? Both Courts have relied on the doctor who says emphatically that the injury was fatal. We see no reason to differ from that and can find nothing to indicate negligence.\n10. The dying declaration (Ex. K) states--\n \"Regular and proper breathing is not possible for me\"\nand the doctor explains that the power of controlling respiration is lost when the diaphragm is injured and there is a chance of collision between the organs of the chest and the abdomen. The 'post-mortem' reveals that that is just what happened, the stomach and the omentum had herniated together and the omentum protruded through the hole which the injury had made. The pleura and the diaphragm were both cut and the injury had extended right up to the abdominal cavity. We accept the finding that the injury was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.\n11. It was then argued that this was a case of a sudden fight and so the case falls within the fourth Exception to Section 300; I.P.C. It is enough to say that the Exception requires that no undue advantage be taken of the other side. It is impossible to say that there is no undue advantage when a man stabs an unarmed person who makes no threatening gestures and merely asks the accused's opponent to stop fighting. Then also, the fight must be with the person who is killed.\nHere the fight was between Velayudhan (P.W. 1) and the appellant. The deceased had no hand in it. He did not even try to separate the assailants. All he did was to ask his son-in-law Velayudhan (P.W. 1) to stop fighting and said that he would settle their dispute.\n12. It was argued that this indicated a threat -- at any rate, the appellant who was already angered by the slap, was justified in taking the remark in that light and consequently believing that he was going to be attacked by the deceased. But the evidence does not bear that out and the account given by the appellant has not been believed.\nHe says that the deceased beat him and grappled with him and that they fell down several times and that eventually the deceased seized him by the neck. All this is a question of fact on which there arc concurrent findings. In our opinion, the Exception does not apply and the appellant was rightly convicted under Section 302, Indian Penal. Code.\n13. On the question of sentence we feel the lesser sentence is called for because the slap on the face evidently made the appellant, who appears to be a hot blooded man, lose control of himself. That would not afford justification for killing an innocent by-stander who intervenes with a mild admonition to the appellant's adversary to stop fighting.\nBut we feel that on the question of sentence this is not the type of case in which the death sentence is called for. There was no premeditation and the knife was not ready in the hand but was drawn from the waist after the appellant had been slapped and the quarrel between Velayudhan (P.W. 1) and him had started. We, therefore, reduce the sentence to one of transportation for life.\n14. The appeal succeeds on the questions of sentence only.\n"}, {"id": "912630", "date": "9/1955", "tagline": "S.Khader Sheriff vs Munnuswami Gounder And Others on 15 September, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nS.KHADER SHERIFF\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nMUNNUSWAMI GOUNDER AND OTHERS.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n15/09/1955\n\nBENCH:\nAIYYAR, T.L.

This is an appeal by special leave from the Judgment of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla convicting the appellant Mohinder Singh, aged 25 years, under Section 302, I. P. C. and sentencing him to death. The appellant along with his sister's son, Baj Singh, had been placed on trial for the murder of Kapur Singh. Both had been convicted of the offence and sentenced, the appellant as stated above, and Baj Singh to transportations for life. On appeal Baj Singh was acquitted by the High Court on giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n2. The facts of this case may shortly be stated as follows: At about 2-30 a.m. on 29-5-1954, the first information report was lodged by Sunder Singh, lambardar of village Chirewan, at police station Muktsar in the district of Ferozepore, to the effect that Phula Singh (P.W. 1) was a displaced person from the district of Lahore. He had been settled in the village Chirewan on an allotment of 16 standard acres of land. He had three sons and a daughter who was married to the appellant Mdhinder Singh. Mohinder Singh was also a displaced person from West Punjab and had been living with his father-in-law Phula Singh for the last three years along with his wife and children. Of the three sons of Phula Singh, Kapur Singh is said to have been the eldest, about 45 years of age. He as well as the appellant Mohinder Singh used jointly to cultivate the land allotted to Phula Singh. Mohinder Singh is said to have developed a liaison with Kapur Singh's wife named Har Kaur. As Kapur Singh had a few months before the occurrence come to know of the illicit connection, about ten days before the occurrence fee removed his wife to her father's place. Baj Singh, who is the appellant's sister's son, had come to stay with the family only about a few weeks before the occurrence.\nThe occurrence is said to have taken place on the night between the 28th and 29th of May, 1954, in the courtyard of Phula Singh's house. Three cots more or less contiguous to one another were, found lying at the tune the police visited the spot in the early morning of the 29th May soon after recording the first information report. It was said in the report that the three beds were occupied by the appellant and Baj Singh side by side and by Phula Singh aforesaid. At about midnight, Phula Singh is said to have been aroused from his sleep by the screaming of Kapur Singh that he was being killed. Phula Singh claimed to have identified the two accused as the assailants of Kapur Singh who died then and there as a result of multiple injuries on his person with sharp cutting weapons like a kirpan. When the police turned up for investigation, a bloodstained kirpan, said to have belonged to Baj Singh, was found near about the dead body of Kapur Singh. Mohinder Singh is said to have fled away with his kirpan. Both the assailants are said to have shouted to Phula Singh when he was about to intervene that he should keep out of their way, otherwise he would make himself liable to be similarly dealt with by them. A pair of shoes and a number of clothes said to be the property of accused Baj Singh were also found near one of the cots. On the alarm raised by Phula Singh, a number of persons including Teja Singh (P.W. 4) and Arjan Singh (P.W. 5) and Thakar Singh (not examined) turned up. They also claimed to have identified the two accused while running away from the scene of the occurrence.\n3. Such was the prosecution case that was investigated by the police, and after the necessary commitment proceedings the two accused were placed on their trial. Their defence appears to have been that on 28-5-1954, accused Mohinder Singh had left his father-in-law's village where the murder had taken place for village Beriwala, 70 miles away. The same day his sister's son, the second accused, also left with Mohinder Singh's family for village Beriwala. Three witnesses were examined by the accused in support of their defence which was in the nature of an alibi.\n4. During the trial it was found by the learned trial Judge that Phula Singh (P.W. 1) had a developed cataract which rendered his eyesight \"extremely weak\", with the result, as remarked by the learned Judge, that\n \"he could not make out the fingers of my hand from a distance of two to three feet and can form only a very hazy picture of things lying even at a short distance from him\".\nBut he claimed that at the time of the occurrence his vision was not so bad. The court in order to find out the. truth about this assertion, called the Civil Surgeon of Ferozepore as a court witness. He examined Phula Singh; for his vision and found him (P. W. 1) suffering from \"senile maturing cataract in both the eyes\". The doctor was not naturally in a position to say whether on the date of the occurrence about three and a half months before his deposition his vision could have been better than what he found it.\nDespite this opinion of the doctor, the learned trial Judge found no difficulty in accepting in its entirety the evidence of Phula Singh. He was naturally very much influenced by the consideration that as the father-in-law 6f the accused Mohinder Singh he would not start a false case of murder against him, having already lost his eldest son as a result of the murder. He also accepted the evidence of P. Ws. 4 and 5 who had turned up on the alarm raised by Phula Singh and found him crying and saying that the two accused had killed his son with kirpans. The third man called Thakur Singh who was also alleged to have similarly turned up and to have seen the accused running away immediately after the occurrence was not examined by the prosecution as the Public Prosecutor appears to have intimated to the court that he would not examine Thakur Singh and Har Kaur (the widow of the murdered person) as they had been won over by the accused. P. Ws. 4 and 5 claimed to have seen accused Mohinder Singh running away with a kirpan and accused Baj Singh empty-handed.\nAt this stage it is significant to note that admittedly the night was a dark one (being three days before the new moon) and still at the dead of night these two witnesses claimed to have noticed consistently that the accused Mohinder Singh had a kirpan in his hand and the other accused was empty-handed, while running away. As will presently appear, this consistent story has been woven round the suspicion of Phula Singh who appears to have convinced himself beyond all possibility of doubt that it was the. two accused who had committed the murder of his son, Kapur Singh. If the evidence of the three witnesses, P. W. 1, Phula Singh, who claims to be an eye-witness to the occurrence, and P. Ws. 4 and 5 who claim to have seen the accused running away immediately after they heard the alarm of P.W. 1, is relied upon, there is no difficulty in holding that there is sufficient evidence to bring the charge home to the accused. That is the view taken by the learned trial Judge and the assessors.\n5. On appeal, however, the learned Judges of the High Court have acquitted Baj Singh giving him the benefit of the doubt on the main question whether he was privy to the plan to murder Kapur Singh and whether he actually took any part in the murder. They did not rely upon the testimony of P. W, 1, Phula Singh, to the effect that Baj Singh also had actually given kirpan blows to the deceased, chiefly on the ground of his bad eyesight.\n6. While acquitting Baj Singh the learned Judges in the court below confirmed the sentence of death passed against the appellant Mohinder Singh and the only question therefore before us is whether the case against the appellant has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt particularly as on the same evidence the High Court did not feel justified in maintaining the conviction and sentence of Baj Sigh. In our opinion, the case against the appellant is not free from doubt, arising from the following considerations. Firstly, P. W. 1, Phula Singh, who figures as the only eye-witness to the occurrence has equally implicated Baj Singh with the appellant.\nAs a matter of fact, the bloodstained kirpan which was found lying near the feet of the dead body was alleged by him as belonging to Baj Singh. The kirpan of the appellant has not been recovered and we do not know whether or not it was also bloodstained. Material exhibits, P-3, P-4 and P-5, newly made clothes said to belong to Baj Singh, and material exhibit P-6, a pair of shoes also said to belong to him, were found near one of the three cots. Those were taken by the trial Judge to be incriminating circumstances against the accused Baj Singh. No such incriminating circumstances were disclosed against the appellant.\nThe appellant has examined three witnesses of the village Beriwala where he had removed with his family on 28th May. They claim to have seen the appellant in that village between 4 and 5 p. m. on that date. That evidence of alibi may not be conclusive in favour of the appellant because there is a possibility of his having taken advantage of a fast conveyance to the railway station and from there travelling by rail back to the village Chirewan. Secondly, the fact remains that it was a dark night and the eyesight of the only eye-witness, Phula Singh, which does not appear to have been such as to enable him distinctly to see even from a distance of a few feet at the dead of the night as to who the assailants were. In spite of those physical disabilities, Phula Singh appears to have convinced himself from the very start that it was the appellant, aided by his sister's son Baj Singh. who had committed the murder. That is the reason why within a few hours of the occurrence the first information report clearly mentions the part said to have been played by the two accused and Phula Singh having informed all those who turned up soon after the occurrence that it was they who had perpetrated the crime. The witnesses who turned up including P. Ws. 4 and 5, naturally did not see any reasons to differ from the inference drawn by Phula Singh aforesaid that it was the two accused and none others who had committed the murder. They had thus no difficulty in filing in the details and coming to court as they did in the full confidence that they had seen all that they had deposed to. It is thus a case of moral certainty from the surrounding circumstances developing into the factual certainty in the minds of the prosecution witnesses aforesaid that the two accused were concerned with the murder. Otherwise it would be difficult to explain the vehemence with which the P. Ws, aforesaid particularly P. W. 1, asserted that the two accused were the real assailants of the deceased.\n7. The judgment of the High Court giving Baj Singh the benefit of the doubt certainly raises a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. The positive evidence against him is not stronger than or any different from the evidence against Baj Singh. But it has been argued on behalf of the prosecution on the authority of the judgment of this Court in -- 'Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab',  with particular reference to the observations at pp. 367-368 that it is possible that the High Court may have been in error in giving Baj Singh the benefit of the doubt and that therefore that circumstance should not weigh in favour of the appellant in this Court. Those observations were made with reference to the facts and circumstances disclosed in the evidence in that case and cannot be taken as laying down any rule of universal application.\nIn the present case we find that the evidence of the three witnesses aforesaid on which the case against the appellant depends is not free from the blemish that they have been more emphatic in their assertions than the circumstances of the case would justify. They were roused from a sound sleep by the alarm raised, in the first instance by the dying man so far as P. W. 1 is concerned, and of P. W. 1 himself so far as the other two witnesses' evidence goes. When they were suddenly roused from their sleep in the early part of the dark night without any previous apprehensions, it would be difficult for them to notice what they claim to have clearly observed. As already indicated, it is a case of their convincing themselves, however honest they may have been, that the two accused were the persons concerned in the crime without having clearly seen them or being able to see them. At any rate, in the case of the first witness for the prosecution who started the theory on which the prosecution case is based, his eyesight appears to have been too dim to enable him to see clearly in the dark night, as he claims to have done, that the two accused had dealt the fatal blows. If the basic evidence of P.  W. 1 is subject to reasonable doubt as to its correctness, as we think it is, there is no difficulty in viewing the evidence of P. Ws. 4 and 5 with the same doubt.\nIn these circumstances we are not satisfied that the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution has brought the charge home to the appellant. We would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the orders of conviction and sentence of the appellant and direct that he be released forthwith.\n"}, {"id": "714937", "date": "9/1955", "tagline": "Saiyid Alimuddin vs Saeed Ahmad on 9 September, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

This is an appeal by special leave granted by this Court on 24-1-1955, on a limited point hereinafter mentioned against the judgment of the Election Tribunal, Meerut, dated 10-10-1954, whereby the Tribunal set aside the election of the appellant as Chairman of the Town Area Committee, Phalaoda, District Meerut, and declared the respondent as the duly  elected Chairman.\n2. Under the U. P. Town Areas Act, 1914 the Chairman of a Town Area Committee is elected directly by the electorates of the Town Area at an election held simultaneously with the general election of the members of the Committee. The election of the Chairman of the Town Area Committee, Phalaoda, District Meerut, was held on 28-10-1953. The appellant and the respondent were the only contesting candidates. On counting of votes the appellant was found to have secured 1,980 votes as against 1,280 votes polled, by the respondent. The appellant was accordingly declared to have been elected as the Chairman. On 11-11-1954, the present respondent presented an election petition under Sub-section (4-a) of Section 8-A of the U. P. Town, Areas Act, 1914, as amended, challenging the election of the appellant on various grounds. The present appellant contested that petition. He denied and refuted the various grounds on which his election was challenged.\nOn the allegations made against the appellant the Tribunal held (i) that the appellant had got 19 votes recorded in the names of persons who were not present at Phalaoda at the time when the voting took place, (ii) that the appellant had procured by personation the vote in the name of one Srimati Hafizam who was dead at the time of the election and (iii) that the appellant had procured one Ramji Lal, M. L. A., a Harijan leader, to address a meeting of Harijans in favour of the appellant's candidature wherein threats were held out to Harijans that if they did not vote for the appellant they would be ejected from their lands. In the result, the Tribunal held that the election of the appellant as Chairman was void and, consequently, the Tribunal set his election aside. Further, the Tribunal by the same order declared the respondent to have been duly elected.\n3. On 16-11-1954, the appellant filed before this Court a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court. Special leave was granted by this Court on 24-1-1955, limited to ground of appeal No. (ix) of the petition, namely, \"That in the circumstances of the present case the order of the Tribunal declaring the respondent to be duly elected is illegal.\" In view of this limited nature of the leave the appellant has to accept the position that the three charges have been brought home to him and that his election has been properly set aside. The only point available to him is that the order of the Tribunal declaring the respondent to be duly elected was illegal.\n4. In declaring the respondent to be duly elected as Chairman the Tribunal evidently acted under Rule 53 of the rules framed under Section 8-A of the U. P. Town Areas Act, 1914. That rule funs as follows: --\n\"53. (i) If the judicial officer finds, in respect of any person whose election is called in question by petition that he was not disqualified for election and that his election was valid, he shall dismiss the petition as against such person.\n(ii) If the judicial officer finds that any person whose election is impugned was not qualified for election or that his election was invalid he shall either.\n(a) declare duly elected in his stead the successful candidate in whose favour is recorded the highest number of votes next after all successful candidates or in the case of election for chairmanship, next after the candidates whose election has been challenged as the case may be, or\n \n\n(d) declare a casual vacancy to have been created whichever course appears to him the more appropriate.\"\n5. Clause (ii) empowers the judicial officer, on his arriving at the findings referred to therein, to adopt one of two courses whichever may appear to him the more appropriate. In this case, evidently the Tribunal considered the first course to be the more appropriate.\n6. The appellant contends that this rule vests the judicial officer with a discretion which like all judicial discretions must be exercised according to common sense and according to justice and it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful but legal and regular. Reference is made to Craies on Statute Law, Fifth Edition, page 252 as showing the principles laid down by the Courts for the exercise of discretion vested in Judicial Tribunals. The complaint of the appellant is (1) that the Tribunal did not at all exercise its discretion and (2) that, in any event, it has not done so judicially, but simply declared the respondent as duly elected as if it were a corollary flowing from the setting aside of the election of the appellant.\nIn the statement of case filed on behalf of the appellant, however, the grievance has not been formulated in the way it has been done before us. There, the grievance made was that the Tribunal could not declare the respondent as duly elected unless it found (a) that in fact the respondent had received a majority of the valid votes or (b) that but for the votes obtained by the appellant by corrupt or illegal practices the respondent would have obtained a majority of the valid votes. The objection as formulated there is clearly founded on principles which govern parliamentary elections under the Representation of the People Act and the Rules framed thereunder. Those rules, however, did not govern the election in question which is, governed by the special rule quoted above.\nThe Tribunal found that the election of the appellant was invalid on account of very serious misconduct on his part, namely, that the appellant procured undue influence to be exercised on the electorates and there was impersonation of absent voters and of even a dead voter. Further, there was tampering with the Death Register which could only be in the interest of the appellant. These findings indicate that the appellant had committed corrupt practice under Rule 49 and made himself liable to the penalties prescribed by Rule 54, under which the Magistrate \"may declare him to be disqualified for a period not exceeding five years from being an elector of town area or for being appointed to or retained in any office or place in the gift or disposal of the Committee.\" There was no other candidate contesting the election besides the appellant and the respondent.\nIn these circumstances the appellant's election being set aside, the Tribunal adopted the first course that was open to it to take under Rule 53(ii)(a) which evidently appeared to be the more appropriate course to take. Having regard to the language of the rule under which the Tribunal acted and the circumstances alluded to above we are not prepared to say that the Tribunal acted wrongly in exercise of its powers under the rule referred to above.\n7. The result, therefore, is that there is no substance in this appeal and it must stand dismissed with costs. \n"}, {"id": "24666709", "date": "9/1955", "tagline": "V.O.

The appellants 2 to 6 are the legal representatives of V.O. Vakkan who was the plaintiff in the Subordinate Judge's Court and the appellant before the High Court of Madras.\n2. V.O. Vakkan was a resident of Palluruthy in the Cochin State and was trading in coir yarn. He was assessed by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer, Chowghat (Madras State) to a sales tax of Rs. 12,301/4/- on a net turnover of Rs. 12,30,124/- for the year ending 31-3-1946, under the Madras General Sales Tax Act. He objected to this assessment on the ground that he was a non-resident foreigner so far as the Madras State was concerned and that he did not carry on any business either personally or through any agent within that State.\nHis objections were overruled by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer, the Commercial Tax Officer of Malabar and the Board of Revenue. . Thereupon, he filed a suit O. S. No. 25 of 1948 in the Subordinate Judge's Court, Cochin, for a declaration that, the assessment was unauthorised, illegal, and 'ultra vires'. The Subordinate Judge dismiss ed his suit, and on appeal, the High Court of Madras upheld the dismissal but gave the plaintiff leave to appeal on the ground that, the appeal involved a substantial question of law concerning the interpretation of the Madras General Sales Tax Act;\n3. It is admitted that Vakkan was residing in Palluruthy and had his factory and place of business in that place. He was not a resident of the Madras State and had no place of business within that State and had no agent there. It was found, however, by the courts below that many, if not all, of the contracts of sale of coir yarn were entered into by him with European firms in Fort Cochin which is part or the Madras State; & the goods were deliverable and delivered in the yards of the purchasers in the said place.\nIt was held on these facts that Vakkan, the plaintiff, was a \"dealer\" within the definition of the term found in the Madras General Sales Tax Act and he was properly assessed.\n4. Mr. K.S. Krishnaswamy Iyengar, the learned counsel for the appellant, challenged firstly the finding that the contracts of sale were entered into in Fort Cochin and he contended that there was no evidence to justify it. There is the evidence of the 3rd wit ness for the defendant in support of the finding. Further, the plaintiff did not set out any such plea in his reply to the demand notice of the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer or even in his plaint; and the Subordinate Judge observes: \"It is not denied that some of the contracts were executed in Fort Cochin\".\n5. The second point taken was that the plaintiff was a non-resident foreigner who had no place of business in the Madras State and that he was not therefore liable to sales tax. If for executing the contracts or delivering the goods he came into Fort Cochin, he may not be regarded as a non-resident for eigner. But the question of his residence is really immaterial. We have to see whether he is a \"dealer\" within the meaning of the Act; and he is undoubtedly so, as he is a person who carried on the business of selling goods within the State of Madras, Explanation (2) to Section 2 makes the agent (if any) also a \"dealer\" and is not intended to take the principal outside the scope of liability.\n6. Therefore the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\n"}, {"id": "1347962", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "Willie (William) Slaney vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 31 October, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nWILLIE (WILLIAM) SLANEY\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n31/10/1955\n\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nAIYAR, N.

The appellant was specifically charged with murder in\nprosecution of the common intention.  There was evidence  to\nshow that he and not his brother had struck the fatal  blow.\nThe  brother was acquitted and the appellant  was  convicted\nunder s. 302 and sentenced to transportation for life.\t The\nHigh Court upheld the conviction and sentence and  dismissed\nthe appeal.  The question was whether the omission to  frame\nan  alternative\t charge\t under s.  302\tsimpliciter  was  an\nillegality  that  vitiated  the trial  and  invalidated\t the\nconviction and whether there was a conflict of decisions  of\nthis Court on the matter in controversy.\nHeld  per curiam, that the omission to frame an\t alternative\ncharge\tunder s. 302 in the facts and circumstances  of\t the\ncase was not an illegality that vitiated the trial but was a\ncurable irregularity as it had not occasioned any  prejudice\nto the appellant and the conviction was not liable to be set\naside.\nThat  s.  34  of the Indian Penal Code by  itself  does\t not\ncreate any offence and where, as in the present case, it  is\npossible  to ascertain who struck the fatal blow,  the\tfact\nthat  another  was also sought to be made  liable  does\t not\ninvalidate   a\tconviction  for\t murder\t unless\t there\t was\nprejudice.\nThat the expression 'illegality' used in Nanak Chand's case\nmust be read with reference to the facts of that case  where\nthe court\n1141\nfound  prejudice, and the apparent conflict of view  between\nthe  judgment in that case and that in Suraj Pal's case\t had\nreally no bearing on the present one.\nNanak  Chand v.

The question of prejudice is a question\nof fact to be decided by the court in each particular case.\nThat  the offence committed by the appellant fell under\t the\nsecond\tpart of s. 304 of the Indian Penal Code and  not  s.\n302  and  the conviction must be altered to one\t under\tthat\nsection.\nN.

The State of Punjab ([1954] S.C.R. 904) and\nBegu v. KingEmperor ([1925] I.L.R. 6 Lah. 226), referred to.\nPer  S. R. DAS, ACTING C.J. and BOSE J.-Like all  procedural\nlaws the Code of Criminal Procedure is designed to  subserve\nthe  ends  of  justice and not to  frustrate  them  by\tmore\ntechnicalities.\t It regards some of its provisions as  vital\nbut  others  not, and a breach of the latter  is  a  curable\nirregularity  unless the accused is prejudiced thereby.\t  It\nplaces\terrors in the charge, or even a total absence  of  a\ncharge in the curable class.  This is made clear by ss.\t 535\nand 537 of the Code.\nThe  object of the charge is to give the accused  notice  of\nthe   matter  he  is  charged  with  and  does\t not   touch\njurisdiction.\tIf, therefore, the necessary information  is\nconveyed to him in other ways and there is no prejudice, the\ntrial  is not invalidated by the mere fact that\t the  charge\nwas not formally reduced to writing.  The essential part  of\nthis  part of the law is not any technical formula of  words\nbut  the  reality, whether the matter was explained  to\t the\naccused\t and whether he understood what he was\tbeing  tried\nfor.\nIt  is\tnot correct to say that s. 535 of the  Code  has  no\napplication to a case in which there is no charge at all  or\nthat  it cannot apply except where ss. 237 and 238 apply  or\nthat it is governed by s. 233.\nSections   237,\t 238,  535  and\t 537  should  not  be\tread\ndisjunctively.\tThey cover every possible case that  relates\nto  the\t charge and they place all failures to\tobserve\t the\nrules\tabout  the  charge  in\tthe  category\tof   curable\nirregularities.\nSections 535 and 537 apply to every case in which there is a\n1142\ndeparture from the rules set out in Chapter XIX ranging from\nerror,\tomissions  and irregularities in  charges  that\t are\nframed, down to charges that might have been framed and were\nnot and include a total omission to frame a charge at all at\nany stage of the trial.\nIn judging a question of prejudice, as of guilt, courts must\nact with a broad vision and look to the substance and not to\ntechnicalities;\t and  their main concern should\t be  to\t see\nwhether\t the accused had a fair trial, whether he knew\twhat\nhe was being tried for, whether the main facts sought to  be\nestablished  against  him were explained to him\t fairly\t and\nclearly\t and whether he was given a full and fair chance  to\ndefend himself.\nThere  is  no conflict of view between Nanak  Chand  v.\t The\nState  of  Punjab and Suraj Pal v. The State of U.P.  and  a\nclose  consideration of the reasons given in  Nanak  Chand's\ncase show that there was in fact no difference of opinion as\nregards\t cases\twhere  there  is a  charge  to\tstart  with.\nNeither\t case, however, deals with the position where  there\nis no charge at all.  The remarks made in Nanak Chand's case\nmust  be read in the perspective indicated  and\t expressions\nwhich  appear  to  travel  wider  do  not  give\t a   correct\nexposition of the law.\nThe effect of charging two persons with murder committed  in\npursuance  of a common intention under s. 34 of\t the  Indian\nPenal Code is that the accused is unmistakably told that  he\nparticipated  in the crime.  Where it cannot be\t ascertained\nwho struck the fatal blow no conviction can follow unless  a\ncommon intention is proved.  But the converse does not\thold\ngood.\nPer  JAGANNADHADAS  and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR  JJ.  (IMAM  J.\nagreeing).   Sections  226, 227, 232(1), 237,  535  and\t 537\nindicate  that\tin the generality of cases the\tomission  to\nframe  a charge is not per se fatal.  It is not,  therefore,\ncorrect to say that where there is no charge the  conviction\nmust  be  illegal,  prejudice or no prejudice.\t Nor  is  it\ncorrect to say that s. 535 is sufficiently wide to apply  to\nevery  case  where there is no charge of any kind  from\t the\noutset.\t  The  section\tcannot\tbe  construed  in  such\t  an\nunlimited  sense  and  must normally be\t read  in  the\tsame\ncontext as ss. 225,226 and 232, that is, with reference to a\ntrial that validly commenced, for there may be cases where a\ntrial  without\tany kind of charge from the outset  will  be\nwholly\tcontrary to the provisions of the Code and  as\tsuch\nillegal without the necessity of a positive finding of\tpre-\njudice.\nThe   provisions  of  S.  535  mainly  apply  to  cases\t  of\ninadvertence  to frame a charge induced by the\tbelief\tthat\nthe matter on record is sufficient to warrant the conviction\nfor  a particular offence without express specification\t and\nwhere  the facts proved constitute a separate  and  distinct\noffence\t but  closely relevant to and springing out  of\t the\nsame set of facts connected with the one charged.\nThe Code requires that in a sessions trial there should be a\n1143\ncharge\tin  writing.   A deliberate  breach  of\t this  basic\nrequirement  cannot be covered by the assertion\t that  every\nthing was orally explained to the accused, the assessors  or\njurors\tand  there  was no prejudice.\tSo  also  where\t the\nconviction  is for a totally different offence from the\t one\ncharged and not covered by ss. 236 and 237 of the Code,\t the\nomission  to frame a separate charge would be  an  incurable\nirregularity amounting to illegality.\nIn  cases  coming under ss. 34, 114 and 149  of\t the  Indian\nPenal  Code the charge against persons actuated by a  common\nintention is a rolled-up one.  It involves direct  liability\nand  constructive liability without distinct  specification.\nThe  absence of a charge under one or other of\tthe  various\nheads of criminal Liability for the offence in such cases is\nnot  fatal  and a conviction for  the  substantive  offence,\nwithout\t a  charge,  can be set aside only  where  there  is\nprejudice.\nIn  considering\t whether  a  defect  is\t illegal  or  merely\nirregular,  several  facts  will  have\tto  be\t considered,\nincluding  its gravity to determine if it falls\t within\t one\nclass or the other.  The answer must depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case.  If the defect is so grave\tthat\nprejudice would necessarily be implied, it is an illegality.\nIf less serious, it will be an irregularity and prejudice by\nway of failure of justice must be established.\nHoward v. Bodington ([1877] 2 P.D. 203), referred to.\nPer  IMAM J.-On the facts of the present case  the  question\nraised\tby  the\t reference  does not  arise.   There  is  no\nsubstantial  conflict of view between the two  decisions  of\nthis court in Nanak Chand's case and Suraj Pal's case.\nSection\t 233  of the Code is a mandatory provision  and\t the\nforce  of  its direction is not weakened by  the  fact\tthat\nanother provision of the Code permits the conviction of\t the\naccused for an offence with which he had not been charged.\nThe total absence of a charge from the beginning to the\t end\nwhere  it  is incumbent that a charge must be  framed  is  a\ncontravention  of  the Code regarding the mode of  trial  it\nprescribes and a conviction of the accused in such a case is\ninvalid\t and no question of prejudice can arise.  In  cases,\nhowever,  where a charge is framed but there is an  omission\nor  irregularity but the mode of trial is not  affected\t the\nCode  provides that the conviction may be set aside  if,  in\nfact, a failure of justice as resulted.\t It is difficult  to\nlay  down any hard and fast rule as to the applicability  of\ns. 535.\t That will depend on the facts of each case.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:\n"}, {"id": "701977", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "Matajog Dobey vs H.

The   common    question\t for\ndetermination  in both the complaints was whether under\t the\ncircumstances  sanction\t was necessary under s. 197  of\t the\nCode of Criminal Procedure.\nHeld that sanction was necessary as the assault and the\t use\nof criminal force related to the performance of the official\nduties\tof the accused within the meaning of s. 197  of\t the\nCode of Criminal Procedure.\n Art.  14  does not render s. 197 of the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure  ultra vires as the discrimination on the part  of\nthe Government to grant sanction against one public  servant\nand   not   against   another  is  based   on\ta   rational\nclassification.\nA  discretionary power is not necessarily  a  discriminatory\npower  and abuse of power is not easily to be assumed  where\nthe  discretion\t is vested in the Government and  not  in  a\nminor official.\nIn the matter of grant of sanction under s. 197 of the\tCode\nof  Criminal  Procedure, the offence alleged  to  have\tbeen\ncommitted by the accused must have something to do, or\tmust\nbe  related  in some manner with the discharge\tof  official\nduty.  In other words there must be a reasonable  connection\nbetween the act and the discharge of official duty; the\t act\nmust bear such relation to the duty that the\n926\naccused could lay a reasonable claim, but not a pretended or\nfanciful  claim,  that\the  did it in  the  course  of\tthis\nperformance of his duty.\nThe  need for sanction under s. 197 of the Code of  Criminal\nProcedure is not necessarily to be considered as soon as the\ncomplaint   is\tlodged\tand  on\t the   allegations   therein\ncontained.   The  question  may arise at any  stage  of\t the\nproceedings.   The complaint may not disclose that  the\t act\nconstituting the offence was done or purported to be done in\nthe  discharge\tof  official duty;  but\t facts\tsubsequently\ncoming to light on a police or judicial inquiry, or even  in\nthe  course  of the prosecution evidence at the\t trial,\t may\nestablish ,the necessity for sanction.\tWhether sanction  is\nnecessary  or  not may have to be determined from  stage  to\nstage.\tThe necessity may reveal itself in the course of the\nprogress of the case.\nWhere  a power is conferred or a duty imposed by statute  or\notherwise,  and there is nothing said  expressly  inhibiting\nthe exercise of the power or the performance of the duty  by\nany  limitations or restrictions, it is reasonable  to\thold\nthat it carries with it the power of doing all such acts  or\nemploying  such means as are reasonably necessary  for\tsuch\nexecution, because it is a rule that when the law commands a\nthing to be done, it authorises the performance of  whatever\nmay be necessary for executing its command.\nGill  and another v.

These two appeals arise out of the same judgment and order of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court, on leave granted by it at the same time that the judgment was delivered. Something will have to be said in the course of this judgment about the legality or regularity of the leave so granted. There are 16 appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 118 of 1954 and only one appellant in 119 of 1954.\nBoth the appeals relate to the occurrence which took place on the morning of the 7th February 1952 at village Goran, police station Ait, in the district of Jalaun of the State of Uttar Pradesh. 57 persons were, placed on trial before the learned Sessions Judge of Orai on charges under Sections 120B and 148, Indian Penal Code, as also under Sections 201, 302, 325 and; 452, all read with Section 149, Indian Penal Code.\nThe learned trial Judge acquitted all the accused in respect of the charge under Section 120B, Indian Penal Code. He convicted 36 of them under Sections 148, 201/ 149 and 302/149, Indian Penal Code, of whom nine were sentenced to death and the others to transportation for life under Section 302/149, to two years rigorous imprisonment under Section 148, Indian Penal Code and to seven years rigorous imprisonment under Section 201/149 in respect of four of them, and to three    years imprisonment in respect of the rest.\nNo more need be said about the convictions and sentences under Section 325/149, Indian Penal Code, because those have not been maintained by the High Court on appeal. Some of them had also been convicted under Section 452 and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years. One more accused named Kamoda Chamar was convicted under Section 325/149, Indian Penal Code and sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment. Thus in all 37 out of the 57 accused were convicted and sentenced by the trial court, partly in agreement and partly in disagreement with the assessors.\n2. On appeal, the High Court dismissed the appeal of Baladin Lodhi, who is the first appellant before us, and affirmed his convictions and sentences under Sections 148, 452, 302/149 and 201/149, Indian Penal Code and accepted the reference, by confirming the sentence of death passed against him in respect of the charge under Section 302/149.\nIn respect of the other appellants who had been sentenced to death, the High Court allowed the appeal of four of them and acquitted them and in respect of the others allowed their appeal on the question of sentence under Section 302/149 by giving them the lesser sentence of transportation for life. The High Court allowed the appeal of twenty of the appellants before it and acquitted them of all charges. In the result, the High Court confirmed the convictions and sentences in respect of the remaining 17 appellants before it with the modification on the question of sentence as aforesaid.\nHence 16 of them figure as the appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 118 of 1954 and Jangi is the sole appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 119 of 1954. Both these appeals have been heard together and will be disposed of by this judgment.\n3. Before setting out the case against the accused it is necessary briefly to notice the background of the events leading up to the ghastly occurrence. Twelve or thirteen refugee families' from the West Punjab were rehabilitated in village Goran which is about 10 miles from Orai town by the direct 'kachha' route and about 25 miles by the road proper.\nThe State Government provided those displaced families with lands for cultivation and sites in the village 'abadi' for residential purposes, as also loans for helping them to settle in their new homes. But unfortunately the new-comers were not welcome to the old residents of the village because they were looked upon as competitors for house sites and culturable lands of the village. The result was a great deal of tension between the old residents on the one side and the new settlers on the other.\nMutual recriminations followed and some incidents of a minor nature, like cattle grazing disputes and simple assaults, took place. All the four years that the new displaced families had come to stay in the village there were allegations of harassment on both sides and complaints to the public authorities. The gulf between the two factions widened until the climax was reached on the 4th February 1952, that is to say, three days before the occurrence which was the subject matter of the charges against the accused persons.\nOn that date Vir Singh 'alias Vir Lodhi was alleged to have secured the services of one Shambhu Lodhi, resident of district Hamirpur, who is alleged to be a notorious character. It is admitted by both parties that an incident took place between Diwan Singh and Mangal Singh, two of the displaced persons on the one side, and Vir Singh Lodhi and Shambhu Lodhi on the other, in which grievous hurt was said to have been caused to Shambhu Lodhi and simple injuries to the displaced persons, leading to the lodging of counter informations at the police station.\nBoth sides had some injuries, though not equally serious but it appears, as found by the courts below, that the incident was very lightly treated by the police and not at all as the precursor of more serious events which actually took place three days later. As the refugees found the attitude of the local police hostile to them, 13 male members of the refugee families including Mool Singh, Mela Singh, Sant Singh and Ravel Singh, four of the six persons who were cruelly done to death in cold blood in the occurrence of the 7th February, came to Orai on the morning of the 5th February 1952 to report the matter to the district authorities and to the Refugee Officer.\nThey succeeded only in making an application to the Refugee Officer and could not get the district authorities to lend them a hearing. Disappointed at this attitude of the district authorities, they decided to file a regular complaint in court against Shambhu aforesaid and others. They spent the 6th February in making further attempts to contact the public authorities to ventilate their grievances and in preparing a complaint to be filed in court.\n4. Things were happening in the other camp also at village Goran. The villagers are said to have assembled at the house of Parichhat Lodhi, adjacent to the house of Mangal Singh, one of the refugees, after having come to know that most of the male members of the refugee families had gone to the district headquarters to take steps against them. The villagers are said to have resolved to kill all the male members of the refugee families so as to put an end to what they thought was the recurring trouble.\nWhen Ravel Singh and Kartar Singh, two of the 13 refugees who had gone to Orai, came back to their village, were informed by their womenfolk of the conspiracy said to have been hatched by the villagers that very evening. Naturally therefore, they came post-haste that same night, that is to say, the night between the 6th and 7th February to Orai and informed their other male members about the resolution.\nSuch an alarming news caused a great deal of commotion amongst the refugees and they forthwith got their applications prepared for presentation to the District Magistrate, the Superintendent of Police and the Refugee Officer informing them about the aforesaid resolution of the old residents of the village and their apprehensions about the safety of their persons and imploring the authorities to give them and their families protection against the threatened attack.\nThey also made it clear to those authorities that the situation was so grave that they had decided to go to the village Goran under the cover of the night to rescue their families and to bring them back to safety. It was decided that six of the refugees, namely, Mool Singh, Mela Singh, Ravel Singh son of Mangal Singh, Sant Singh, Kastura Singh and Harbans Singh should go back to the village to rescue their families. Those were the six unfortunate victims of the occurrence which took place the next morning.\n5. As soon as those six ill-fated persons reached the village on the morning of the 7th February 1952 at about sunrise, they found their womenfolk in a state of alarm and collected at the house of Mangal Singh aforesaid. They were apprised of the desperate situation in which the womenfolk found themselves in the absence of the male members. After talking over the situation at both ends and exchanging information, three of them, namely, Mela Singh, Ravel Singh and Mool Singh were taken upstairs for having their breakfast after their night's journey.\nThus when three of the six male members who had arrived from Orai were upstairs and the other three, Kastura Singh, Harbans Singh and Sant Singh, were on the groundfloor of the house, suddenly a crowd of 80 to 100 persons surrounded the said Mangal Singh's house armed with axes, spears, daggers, guns, etc. Narain Das Lodhi and Baladin Lodhi along with 15 to 20 other Lodhis appeared on the first floor of Mangal Singh's house with guns and shot down those three persons.\nThe other Lodhis were also said to have attacked those three unfortunate male members and belaboured them with their lethal weapons. As soon as Mela Singh received two gunshot wounds and rolled down in his attempt to run downstairs, he was picked up by Smt. Bhagwanti (one of the four eyewitnesses examined in the case) and was hidden in the grain room of Mangal Singh's house. The Lodhis who were on the first floor of the house threw the dead bodies of Mool Singh and Ravel Singh from the roof of Mangal Singh's house towards the cattle shed of Mahabir, one of the appellants.\nThe three other male members of the refugee families who were on the ground floor were prevented from escaping, by the large mob assembled in front of Mangal Singh's house. Some of the members of the mob who had guns with them (Prabhu Dayal and Shobha Lal not before the court) fired a number of shots at those three persons and killed them. The other members of the mob are said to have belaboured those unfortunate victims with their spears, axes and daggers.\nMela Singh who had been concealed as aforesaid in the grain room of Mangal Singh's house was said to have been dragged out by Raja Ram and Mahabir, two of the appellants and others. When taken out of the room, he was said to have been assaulted by Jangi Lodhi, the sole appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 119 of 1954 and by other persons not before the court, with axes, and by Uma Charan, another appellant, with a sword, and thus some of the members of the unlawful assembly finished him off also.\nThe dead bodies of all those six helpless victims were then dragged to the front of Manna Teli's house. Two bullock carts, one belonging to and driven by Manna Teli, and the other belonging to and driven by Vira Lodhi, two of the appellants, were loaded each with three of the dead bodies and carried to the tank in the village. A tin of kerosene oil was sprinkled on the dead bodies and Vira Lodhi and others are said to have set fire to the joint pyre of those six dead bodies which were thus burnt to ashes.\nSuch was the ghastly tragedy which is said to have been witnessed by four of the female inmates in the house at that time, namely, Mst. Paiyyan Devi (P.W. 18), Mst. Shanti Devi (P.W. 21), and Mst. Parvati (P. W. 22), who were the widows respectively of Mela Singh, Mool Singh and Sant Singh, three of the six victims and the fourth Mst. Bhagwanti (P.W. 20), wife of Mangal Singh and mother of the fourth victim Ravel Singh.\n6. While the aforesaid six male members had thus met their unnatural death, the remaining male refugees who had stayed back at Orai were trying to get into touch; with the public authorities on the 7th February, without any success. In the meantime, at about 2 p.m., when they were waiting at the residence of the Superintendent of Police for an interview, two of the members brought the sad news from the market where they had gone for their meals that there was a rumour that those six refugees who had left for the village had been murdered.\nThey naturally all began to weep and bemoan their lot and then the Superintendent of Police on coming to know of the sad news granted them an interview. He directed the Circle Inspector, Kabir Ahmad (P.W. 27) at about 4-30 p.m. to proceed to the village on a truck with an armed guard and the refugees. After sunset, on the way he met Raj Bahadur Singh, Sub-Inspector of Police in charge Ait police station coming towards Orai by a passenger bus, apparently completely ignorant of what had happened at the village Goran.\nThis ignorance may have been due to the fact that at about 5 p.m. the same day the village chowkidar Ramola, one of the appellants, had lodged an information at the police station that all was quiet in the village. As will presently appear, it was the quiet of a deserted village after the holocaust and the burning of the dead bodies by the members of the mob.\nThe Circle Inspector with Sub-Inspector Raj Bahadur Singh went to the police station, strengthened their force and then reached the village at about midnight between the 7th and 8th February. At that time the village presented a deserted appearance with no lights in any house and no whispers from any direction. The original residents of the village, as also the refugees, it appears, had for the time being completely abandoned the village.\nMangal Singh and Diwan Singh, refugees, took the police truck to village Kotra, about two and a half miles away from village Goran in search of their womenfolk and children. On the way, in the jungle they picked up some of their womenfolk and children and brought them back to the village. In the morning of the 8th February, the Deputy Superintendent of Police also arrived with some of the refugee ladies, namely, Mst. Paiyyan Devi and Smt. Bhagwanti Devi, two of the four eye-witnesses aforesaid to the unfortunate occurrence.\nThese two ladies had trudged until midnight from the village to Orai and informed the Superintendent of Police about the occurrence to which they were eye-witnesses. It was then that the Superintendent of Police deputed the Deputy Superintendent of Police to look into the matter. Until he reached that village next morning no progress had been made in the investigation of the case as he found the Sub-Inspector asleep.\n7. A remarkable feature of the case, as pointed out by the courts below, is the unsatisfactory manner in which the police investigation took place. It appears that the local police from the village chowkidar upwards were not only apathetic but definitely hostile to the refugees. Instead of taking recourse to preventive action in view of the rising tension between the two parties in the village, things were allowed to drift until the unfortunate occurrence, as described above, took place.\nEven then the Sub-Inspector of Police, Raj Bahadur Singh (P.W. 30), did not take prompt measures to apprehend the culprits. Not only that; as pointed out by the courts below, from the very start of his investigation he gave such a twist to the prosecution case, by the entries in his diary, as to make it appear that the occurrence had taken place not in broad daylight, as really was the prosecution case, but in the darkness of the night so that identification of the culprits would be difficult, if not impossible.\nNaturally, there was a complaint to the superior officers against him and that very day the investigation was taken out of his hands and Circle Inspector Kabir Ahmad (P.W. 27) was placed in charge of the police investigation. But he also does not appear to have been immune from the local police bias in favour of the accused, with the result that on further complaints being made he was also relieved of the investigation on the 21st February 1952.\nThe then Deputy Superintendent of Police, C.B. Singh (P.W. 28) did not start the investigation in right earnest until the 30th May, 1952, though he is said to have taken charge of the investigation from Inspector Kabir Ahmad on the 22nd or 23rd February 1952. All he did up till then was to raid the houses of several of the accused persons in that village to effect their arrest, to serve warrants of attachment and proclamation under Sections 87 and 88, Criminal Procedure Code and to record the statements of some persons on the 11th and 13th March 1952.\nThe bulk of the investigation by him was made after the 30th May 1952 and even then the record of statements of witnesses made to him does not do credit to a senior police officer, inasmuch as he failed to record the statements with particular reference to the individual part said to have been played by the accused persons, though he admitted that the witnesses examined by him had assigned particular acts to various accused persons.\nIt is manifest that the police officers concerned with the investigation of the case did not fully realize the gravity of the situation and did not take prompt steps to collect evidence of an occurrence which on the face of it was rather of an unusual character in so far as it had been the result of a preconcerted plan to annihilate the male members of the refugee families which were being treated by the residents of the village as so many usurpers of their culturable lands and house sites.\nEven if the police had realized the seriousness of the situation, they did not prove equal to the occasion. Either they were incompetent or were unwilling to take all necessary steps to vindicate justice and to inspire confidence in the minds of the aggrieved party. As will presently appear, this remissness on the part of the police officers has had a very adverse effect on the prosecution case and has added to the difficulties of the court in finding out who the real culprits were.\nThough the prosecution did not rely upon the investigation made or purported to have been made by the Sub-Inspector and the Circle Inspector aforesaid, they have been examined as prosecution witnesses in order to enable the parties to elicit such information as they thought necessary and proper.\n8. The defence was a complete denial of all knowledge of the occurrence and the alleged death of all the six male refugees who had travelled on the night between the 6th and 7th February from Orai to the village. The accused persons ascribed their implication in the occurrence to various kinds of enmity between them and the refugee families.\nIt was alleged on behalf of the accused that the refugee families had rendered themselves so obnoxious to the original inhabitants of the village that the villagers, blacksmiths, potters, shoe-makers and other professional persons in the village, including money-lenders and shop-keepers had refused to render them any services because they would not pay for those services. On the main occurrence the suggestion on behalf of the accused persons appears to have been that even if the six refugees had been put to death, the occurrence might have taken place in the darkness of the night in which unknown persons had taken part; and that the admitted enmity between the two parties was the reason for false implication.\nIt is thus clear that it is common ground between the prosecution and the defence that serious enmities existed between the original inhabitants of the village on one side and the refugee families on the other. It is not, as usually happens, a case of animosities between particular individuals on the one side and named individuals on the other.\n9. As a result of police investigation, such as it was, and committal proceedings the accused persons placed at the trial were charged,' firstly, under Section 120B, Indian Penal Code with conspiracy to do illegal acts, namely, to murder and to cause grievous hurt to the refugees in general and to six named refugees as aforesaid in particular; secondly, under Section 148, Indian Penal Code with being members of an unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapons like guns, spears, swords, pharsas, axes and lathis with the common object to cause death and grievous hurt to refugees in general and the six named refugees in particular; thirdly, under Section 452, Indian Penal Code with house trespass by entering into the building belonging to Mangal Singh and used as a human dwelling,, after having made preparations for causing death and hurt; fourthly, under Section 302 read with Section 149, Indian Penal Code with having committed the murder of those six persons in pursuance of the common object of the unlawful assembly and in furtherance of the aforesaid criminal conspiracy; and lastly, under Section 201 read with Section 149, Indian Penal Code for causing the evidence of the aforesaid offences to disappear by burning the dead bodies of those six persons and by throwing the bones and ashes into the village tank.\nReference to the charge under Section 325 read with Section 149, Indian Penal Code is no more necessary at this stage.\n10. The learned Sessions Judge, partly agreeing and partly disagreeing with the opinion of the three assessors who aided him at the trial, for reasons which may not bear scrutiny acquitted all the accused of the charge of conspiracy under Section 120B, although he believed the prosecution case that there was a meeting on the evening of the 6th February at the house of Parichhat Lodhi at which it was resolved that the male members of the refugee families should be killed, as alleged by the prosecution.\nIn respect of the other charges he convicted and sentenced 37 of the accused persons, as stated above. In the course of his judgment the learned trial Judge found that the four women witnesses who figured as the only eye-witnesses of the occurrence were on the whole truthful witnesses who corroborate one another on all material questions; that their statements as recorded by the sub-Inspector, Raj Bahadur Singh, was not a faithful record; that the Circle Inspector of Police did not make any independent record of his own and that the prosecution version, of the occurrence and not the defence suggestions was true.\nHe also observed that the so-called contradictions in the statements of those eyewitnesses as compared with the statements recorded by the investigating Sub-Inspector should not be allowed to affect the credibility of those witnesses because there were clear indications that he did not faithfully record the statements of those witnesses and distorted their versions with a view to favouring the accused persons.\nThe learned Judge also took the precaution of closely scrutinising the evidence of those four eye-witnesses, though he held them to be competent and truthful witnesses, in view of the general tendency in rioting cases of witnesses to rope in also those who may not have been actuated by the common object of the unlawful assembly and may have been present there as mere spectators. He therefore examined the evidence against each individual accused bearing in mind the dictum that mere spectators had to be distinguished from members of the unlawful assembly.\n11. On appeal by the convicted persons, the Division Bench of the High Court wrote a very painstaking judgment which runs into 83 printed pages. The judgment tends to be discursive and could have been more concise without affecting its quality. The High Court went into meticulous details but, as will presently appear, fell into a grievous error as a result of which it acquitted 20 of the appellants, a number of whom had been ascribed leading parts in the occurrence which was the subject matter of the charge against them.\nThe High Court held that the Sub-Inspector, the Circle Inspector and the Deputy Superintendent of Police who were successively in charge of the police investigation, to put it mildly, were not very circumspect in conducting the investigation. The investigation suffered from lack of thoroughness and quickness, with the result that statements of witnesses were recorded by them in the \"most haphazard manner\" and many matters of importance and significance to the case were omitted. It also observed that\n \"Sub-Inspector Raj    Bahadur Singh for oblique  motives  distorted their  statements, ...... that   his   attempt   was   to   introduce such variations in the statements and to leave such loopholes as to damage the ultimate result of the case to as large a measure as possible\".\nThe High Court in the main relied upon the testimony of the four eye-witnesses, the ladies belonging to the family of the victims, but with reference to the testimony of Paiyyan Devi and Shanti Devi further observed that their evidence should be scrutinized and relied upon only when corroborated by other evidence on the record. Hence in respect of those two witnesses, the learned Judges were not as sure as in respect of the others.\nHaving held that the four eye-witnesses were on the whole reliable and that the record of their statements made by the investigating Sub-Inspector was not honest and faithful, the High Court fell into the error of acquitting all those accused persons, appellants before it, whose names did not find a place in the record made by that police officer. In other words it rejected reliable testimony with reference to that very record which it had condemned as unreliable.\nThus the police officer was allowed by the High Court to succeed in his effort to favour the accused. Ordinarily accused persons are entitled to challenge the testimony of witnesses examined in court with reference to the statements said to have been made by them before the investigating police officer. Statements made by prosecution witnesses before the investigating police officer being the earliest statements made by them with reference to the facts of the occurrence are valuable material for testing the veracity of the witnesses examined in court, with particular reference to those statements which happen to be at variance with their earlier statements; but the statements made during police investigation are not substantive evidence.\nHence the record made by a police investigating officer has to be considered by the court only with a view to weighing the evidence actually adduced in court. If the police record becomes suspect or unreliable, as in the present case, on the ground that it was deliberately perfunctory or dishonest, it loses much of its value and the court in judging the case of a particular accused has to weigh the evidence given against him in court keeping in view the fact that the earlier statements of witnesses as recorded by the police is tainted record and has not as reat a value as it otherwise would have in weighing all the material on the record as against each individual accused.\nIn so far as the High Court misled itself into relying upon the record made by the Sub-Inspector of Police to discard the evidence given in the court it fell into a serious error.\n12. On appeal the High Court, as indicated above, acquitted those persons in respect of whom the evidence of the four eye-witnesses was not consistent with their statements as recorded by the investigating Sub-Inspector, though some of them had been assigned leading parts in the occurrence of shooting. After examining in great detail the evidence against each individual accused the High Court delivered its judgment on the 10th September 1954 and presumably at the request of counsel for the 17 persons against whom the High Court maintained the order of conviction, recorded the following order which is the last line and is a part of the judgment of the court:--\n '\"Leave to appeal to Supreme Court is granted\".\nAt the outset the learned counsel for the State of Uttar Pradesh (the respondent) raised a preliminary objection to the hearing of the appeal on the ground that the certificate granted in the terms quoted above is not in full compliance with the provisions of Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution. It was contended that the High Court should have granted the certificate after examining the case of each individual accused, that is to say, that the High Court should have exercised its judicial discretion after satisfying itself that the certificate prayed for should be granted in respect of each and every accused convicted by it.\nIt was argued on behalf of the appellants that the High Court granted the certificate in exercise of its powers contained in Rule 28 of Chapter 23 of the Rules of the Allahabad High Court which required that the counsel for the appellant should pray for the leave at the time the judgment of the High Court is delivered. The leave having been granted in pursuance of that practice, it should be, it was further contended, assumed that the High Court had directed its attention to the case of each individual accused.\n13. The respondent on the other hand contended that the question is concluded by the decision of this Court in 'Nar Singh V. State of U.P.', . We have now to determine whether that is so. That case lays down three propositions:--\n(1) that the mere grant of a certificate does not prevent this Court from determining whether it was rightly granted and whether the conditions pre-requisite to the grant are satisfied;\n(2) that the only condition is the exercise or a judicial discretion by the High Court;\n(3) that being a judicial discretion, it must be exercised along well established lines governing an exercise of judicial discretion; and\n \n\n(4) if the discretion is properly exercised on well established and proper lines, then, as in all cases where an exercise of discretion is involved, there would be no interference except on very strong grounds. We have now to apply these principles to the present case.\n14. Article 134(1)(a) and (b) lay down two conditions which confer a right of appeal to this Court. That in itself indicates that normally there is no right of appeal in any other type of case. The only exception is (c) where a right is conferred (\"an appeal 'shall' lie\") if the High Court \"certifies\" that the case is a fit one for appeal. Now the word \"certifies\" is a strong word.\nIt indicates that the High Court must bring its mind to bear on the question and, as in all cases of judicial orders and certificates, the reasons for the order must be apparent on the face of the order itself. The Supreme Court must be in a position to know first that the High Court has applied its mind to the matter and not acted mechanically and, secondly, exactly what the High Court's difficulty is and exactly what question of outstanding difficulty or importance the High Court feels this Court ought to settle.\nIt is not enough to say \"leave to appeal is given\" and no more because an appeal is not allowed in the ordinary, way when conditions (a) and (b) are not satisfied. Accordingly merely to say that leave is given and no more is tantamount to saying that the High Court will usurp the functions of the Constitution-makers and allow the whole case to be opened up despite the fact that the Constitution has specifically limited the normal right of appeal to Sub-articles (a), and (b) and has left (c) to meet extraordinary cases.\n15. Now, in the present case, where the High Court has merely said \"Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court is granted\". It is impossible for us to gather what induced the High Court to grant this leave or what points of outstanding importance that require to be settled are, in the opinion of the High Court, involved. The learned Judges have not even certified that this is a fit case for appeal.\nHad some reasons been given and the I point or points that it was felt we ought to settle been indicated that might have been treated as a curable irregularity in its procedure. But, as it is, we can only regard this omission as indicative of the fact that the High Court did not realise the responsibility that is cast upon it by Article 134(1) (c) and did not realise that its discretion has to be 'judicially' and not mechanically exercised.\nAccordingly, following our previous decision, we are unable to regard this appeal as properly certified and so decline to accept it as an appeal under Sub-article (c).\n16. In fairness to the learned Judges we have been at pains to see whether there are matters which would have afforded them justification for granting a certificate under Sub-article (c). Four grounds were put forward before us on behalf of the appellants three of which are pure grounds of fact. Now it is clear that a certificate cannot be granted under Sub-article (c) if the High Court is in doubt about 'the facts. If there is doubt in the minds of the learned Judges about the facts, their duty is to acquit They cannot convict and then issue a certificate because they cannot make up their minds about the facts.\n17. The fourth ground taken before us involves a question of law but it is clear that that was not present to the minds of of the learned Judges because they do not even discuss it or advert to it. We are therefore constrained to hold that the appeal does not lie under Sub-article (c). But that still leaves us a discretion to examine whether this is a fit case for us to exercise our special powers under Article 136(1), and that we now proceed to do.\n18. The learned counsel for the appellants raised four questions before us, namely, (1) that the courts below were in error in relying upon the evidence of the four eye-witnesses aforesaid when their statements in court were at variance with their statements as recorded by the investigating Sub-Inspector; (2) that the courts below were in error in convicting and sentencing the appellants on the testimony of those four eye-witnesses when their evidence had not been acted upon in respect of the other accused who had been acquitted by the courts below; (3) that the evidence of those four eye-witnesses having been disbelieved by the lower appellate court, particularly in respect of some of those accused persons to whom they had attributed specific parts, should, not have been accepted in respect of those accused to whom no such parts had been assigned; and (4) that the courts below had erred in law in convicting those accused persons against whom no specific parts had been deposed to and whose mere presence, in the assembly had been penalized.\n(19) It is manifest that the first  three grounds do not make out a case for special leave but we think that the fourth ground does. It is well settled that mere presence in an assembly does not make such a person a member of an unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he had done something or omitted to do something which would make him a member of an unlawful assembly, or unless the case falls under Section 142, Indian Penal Code.\nIn this case there is no doubt that the original inhabitants of the village were all inimically disposed towards the new-comers. From the site plan (Ex. P-18) of the houses of the refugees, it is clear that the houses of the accused persons and of the refugees are situate close to one another. The house of Mangal Singh which was the scene of the occurrence was surrounded by the houses of the original inhabitants of the village including some of the accused persons.\nAccording to the prosecution case, one party of the members of the unlawful assembly entered the first floor of the house of Mangal Singh through the roof of the house of Parichhat Lodhi , adjacent to the south-east and attacked the three persons who were there. The other party of the miscreants collected at the front door of Mangal Singh's house facing west. In front of Mangal Singh's house is the house of Mahabir, appellant, and on the other three sides of that house are the houses of Baladin Lodhi, Parichat Lodhi and Ajodhia Lodhi, appellants.\nIt would thus appear that the place of occurrence is surrounded on all sides by the houses of the appellants. If members of the family of the appellants and other residents of the village assembled, all such persons could not be condemned 'ipso facto' as being members of that unlawful assembly. It was necessary, therefore, for the prosecution to lead evidence pointing to the conclusion that all the appellants before us had done or been committing some overt act in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly.\nThe evidence as recorded is in general terms to the effect that all these persons and many more were the miscreants and were armed with deadly weapons, like guns, spears, pharsas, axes, lathis, etc. This kind of omnibus evidence naturally has to be very closely scrutinised in order to eliminate all chances of false or mistaken implication. That feelings were running high on both sides is beyond question.\nThat the six male members who were done to death that morning found themselves trapped in the house of Mangal Singh has been found by the courts below on good evidence. We have, therefore, to examine the case of each individual accused to satisfy ourselves that mere spectators who had not joined the assembly and who were unaware of its motive had not been branded as members of the unlawful assembly which committed the dastardly crimes that morning.\nIt has been found that the common object of the unlawful assembly was not only to kill the male members of the refugee families but also to destroy all evidence of those crimes. Thus even those who did something in connection with the carrying of the dead bodies or disposal of them by burning them as aforesaid must be taken to have been actuated by the common objective.\n20. There cannot be the least doubt that those who had trespassed into the first floor of the house of Mangal Singh and killed those three refugees who had gone upstairs to have their breakfast were certainly up to their neck in the conspiracy and were thus very active members of the unlawful assembly. In that category are Baladin Lodhi, Parichhat, son of Lallu Lodhi, Ajodhia Lodhi and Parichhat, son of Sadhoo. They have therefore been rightly convicted and sentenced by the court below.\n21. The appellant Raja Ram is a close neighbour of Mangal Singh. He has been assigned a distinct part in the occurrence that morning. He is said to have dragged Mela Singh out of the grain room of Mangal Singh on the first floor. He is also said to have given an axe blow to Mela Singh because he had not died till then as a result of the firing at him.\nThis man    has a   history of   hostility against the refugees. He had litigation with some of the refugee families and was one of those who had falsely and maliciously reported that the two daughters-in-law of Mangal Singh were Muslim girls abducted from West Pakistan. Though the High Court had some doubts as to these specific parts against him because the police records did not show that those parts had been assigned to him and on that account that court reduced the sentence of death to transportation for life under Section 302/149, his conviction under Sections 148, 201/149 and 452 Indian Penal Code has also been upheld.\nHe was apparently very much in the lime-light on that morning. In view of his leading activities against the refugee families, it is not improbable that he took a leading part in the occurrence. His conviction and sentence must therefore be upheld.\n22. The appellant Uma Charan had also been named by all the four eye-witnesses as having taken a leading part in the occurrence. He was said not only to have hit Mela Singh on the head with a sword but was also one of those who took part in the burning of the dead bodies. The episode of the burning of the dead bodies was an essential part of the common object of the unlawful assembly and his presence therefore in that assembly is beyond all doubt.\nIn view of the fact that the use of sword against Mela Singh had been spoken to by only one of the eye-witnesses consistently throughout, though the other eye-witnesses' statement in court on that incident did not find a place in the police diary, the High Court gave him the lesser sentence under Section 302/149, Indian Penal Code, though the trial court had given him the extreme penalty of death under that Section.\nHis conviction under Sections 148, 201/149 has also been upheld. It must therefore be held that he was not a mere spectator in the assembly. His appeal must therefore-also stand dismissed.\n23. Appellant Mahabir Pershad has his cattle shed adjacent to the north of Mangal Singh's house and his residential house is just in front of that house. The two dead bodies of the victims on the first floor of Mangal Singh's house had been thrown into his cattle shed and had been dragged out from there and taken to the open space between the houses of Mannu Teli and Raja Ram, also appellants.\nHe is also said to have dragged out Mela Singh from the place where he had been concealed. That part, according to the High Court, had not been \"conclusively proved\". Hence his sentence under section 302/149 was reduced by the High Court from death to transportation for life. It has been found that he was also present at the time of the disposal of the dead bodies.\nHis convictions under Sections 148, 302/149,201/149 and 452, Indian Penal Code were also upheld. Apparently he had been there from beginning to end. His appeal must therefore also stand dismissed.\n24. Appellant Narain Das was the Mukhia of the village and is a close neighbour of the refugees and lives opposite to the houses of Sant Singh and Mela Singh, two of the victims. He has been assigned the specific part of inciting the mob from near the 'chhabutra' of Mahabir. Hence the evidence of the four eye-witnesses directly implicating him in the crime and assigning him the part of inciting the mob clearly negatives the theory of his having been a mere sightseer.\nThe fact that he is a close neighbour of some of the victims of the occurrence and, therefore, must have been very well known to the witnesses who deposed against him exclude the possibility of a mistake. The courts below were therefore fully justified in believing the testimony of the four eyewitnesses that he took part in the unlawful assembly. His appeal must also stand dismissed.\n25. Appellant Ramola is the village chowkidar. Instead of keeping' the police informed of the developments in the village he went as late as 5 p.m. to the police station to lodge the report that all was well in the village, apparently concealing all that had happened since the early morning that day. The courts below were therefore justified in thinking that his false report at the police station was only meant to shield himself and the other miscreants.\nHe did not move out of the village until all was finished, so that the higher police authorities could not move in the matter until all traces of the crime had been destroyed. This serious dereliction of duty on his part was therefore not a mere act of negligence but intended to throw a veil round the whole occurrence. The courts below were therefore justified in convicting him under Sections 148, 302/149 and 201/149. His appeal must also stand dismissed.\n26. Appellant Vir Singh 'alias' Vira Lodhi had, according to the prosecution case, set the ball rolling by importing into the village the notorious Shambhu Lodhi a few days before the occurrence on 4th February 1952. He is further alleged to have taken three of the dead bodies in his cart to the cremation ground near the pond and the police later on recovered the cart in front of the house with stains of human blood on it. One of the four eye-witnesses also deposed to having seen him on the roof of Mangal Singh's house.\nHence it cannot be said that he was a mere sightseer in that assembly. His appeal was also rightly dismissed by the High Court.\n27. Appellant Mannu Teli also is assigned the specific part of carrying three of the dead bodies on his cart and to have placed them on the funeral pyre. The wheels of his cart which were said to have been thrown into the tank were also recovered by the police. His appeal was also rightly dismissed by the High Court.\n28. It remains to consider the cases of Thakur Das, Ishwari Prasad, Mulloo and Jagdish. These four appellants had not been assigned any particular part in the occurrence nor any overt act has been attributed to them. Of these, Thakur Das is a resident of another village in another police station, though he has cultivation in village Goran. They might possibly have been spectators who got mixed up in the crowd. They will, therefore, be given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted.\n29. It remains to consider the case of the only appellant Jangi in Criminal Appeal No. 119 of 1954. Besides being named and picked out by the four eye-witnesses, he was also alleged to have struck Mela Singh, one of the victims, with an axe. The High Court has thought fit to reduce his sentence from death to that of transportation for life in view of the fact that the statements of the four eye-witnesses as to the part played by him were not supported by the police record.\nBut in view of the fact that even the Deputy Superintendent of Police did not admittedly take note of the individual part played by the accused persons, it is not surprising that the police records do not corroborate the witnesses in court, but there is no contradiction of their statements with reference to their previous statements during the investigation stage. Hence it cannot be said that he was a mere sightseer, when the learned Sessions Judge has found that he was one of the ring-leaders.\n30. In the result, the appeal of Thakur Das, Ishwari Prasad, Mulloo and Jagdish is allowed. Their convictions and sentences are set aside and they will be released forth with. The convictions and sentences in respect of the other appellants are maintained and their appeals dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "752151", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "Indira Sohanlal vs Custodian Of Evacuee ... on 28 October, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nINDIRA SOHANLAL\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nCUSTODIAN OF EVACUEE PROPERTY,DELHI & OTHERS.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n28/10/1955\n\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nAIYAR, N.

As\t the\nassessee  did  not  pay the income-tax\tdue  the  Income-tax\nOfficer issued in April 1951 to the Additional Collector  of\nBombay\ta recovery certificate under s. 46(2) of the  Indian\nIncome-tax  Act,  1922.\t  In February  1954  the  Additional\nCollector  issued a notice of demand and as no\tpayment\t was\nmade  he  attached the good will and tenancy rights  of\t the\nassessee's  premises by a warrant of attachment\t dated\t24th\nMarch 1954,\n888\nA  sale\t was held in February 1955.  The sale  proceeds\t not\nbeing sufficient to satisfy the assessed tax the  Additional\nCollector  issued  a notice under s. 13 of the\tBombay\tCity\nLand  Revenue  Act, 1876 requiring the\tassessee  to  appear\nbefore\thim and show cause why he should not be\t apprehended\nand  confined  to civil prison in satisfaction of  the\tsaid\ncertified  demand.  In default of assessee's appearance\t and\nshowing\t cause a warrant for his arrest was issued under  s.\n13  of\tthe  Bombay  Act, II of 1876  and  he  was  actually\narrested  on  1st July 1955.  An application to\t the  Bombay\nHigh Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution for a writ  in\nthe  nature  of\t a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  having  proved\nunsuccessful, an application under Art. 32 was filed in\t the\nSupreme Court for the same relief.  Two main points urged on\nbehalf of the assessee were:\n(a)  that s. 46(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act under  which\nthe  Income-tax Officer issued the recovery  certificate  to\nthe  Additional Collector of Bombay was void, under Art.  13\n(1) of the Constitution in that it offended Art. 21 and Art.\n14 of the Constitution;\n(b)that\t s. 13 of the Bombay Land Revenue Act, 1876  (Bombay\nAct II of 1876) under which the warrant of arrest was issued\nby the Additional Collector was void under Art. 13(1) of the\nConstitution  as  the same was repugnant to Art. 14  of\t the\nConstitution.\nHeld  (as  regards  a) (1) that there was  no  violation  of\nfundamental  rights  under  Art.  21  of  the\tConstitution\ninasmuch  as s. 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 under  which\nwarrant of arrest was issued for the recovery of the  demand\ncertified  under  s.  46(2) of\tthe  Indian  Income-tax\t Act\nconstituted  a procedure established by law.  Both s. 13  of\nBombay Act II of 1876 and s. 46 of the Indian Income-tax Act\nunder which action had been taken against the assessee\twere\nnot  void and therefore no question of violation  of  funda-\nmental rights under Art. 21 could arise at all)\n(ii)the\t contention that s. 46(2) of the  Indian  Income-tax\nAct  provides for two different and alternative\t methods  of\nrecovery  of  the dues and clothes the\tCollector  with\t the\nunfettered  and\t unguided power to apply either of  the\t two\nmethods inasmuch as it enables the Collector at his will  to\ndiscriminate  between  two  defaulters\twho  are   similarly\nsituated  and thus violates the equal protection  clause  of\nthe  Constitution was without force because sub-section\t (2)\nof  s. 46 does not prescribe two different procedures.\t The\nproviso\t enacted therein does not indicate a  different\t and\nalternative mode of recovery of the certified amount of\t tax\nbut only confers additional powers on the Collector for\t the\nbetter\tand more effective application of the only  mode  of\nrecovery authorised by the body of sub-section (2) of s.  46\nand  therefore there was no question of possibility of\tdis-\ncrimination at all;\n(iii)the  further  contention that s. 46(2)  of\t the  Indian\nIncometax  Act violates the equal protection clause  of\t the\nConstitution  and has thus become void under Art. 14 of\t the\nConstitution  as s. 46(2) required the Collector,on  receipt\nof the requisite certificate from\n889\nthe  Income-tax Officer, to recover the amount specified  in\nthe certificate as if it were an arrear of the land  revenue\nand there are different laws adopted by different States for\nthe   recovery\t of  land  revenues  and   thus\t  there\t  is\ndiscrimination\ton  the ground that defaulters\tare  treated\ndifferently  in different States is also without  force\t be-\ncause\tdiscrimination\tcomplained  of\tis   a\t permissible\nclassification\tand  does not offend the  fundamental  right\nguaranteed  by\tArt. 14 as the grouping\t of  the  income-tax\ndefaulters in separate categories on classes State-wise is a\nterritorial classification which is based on an intelligible\ndifferentia  and there is a reasonable nexus or\t co-relation\nbetween the basis of classification and the object sought to\nbe  achieved  by  the Income-tax Act.\tThe  fact  that\t the\nincome-tax  demand  is\ta  Union  public  demand  makes\t  no\ndifference in the legal position.\nHeld,  (as regards b) that the contention that s. 13 of\t the\nBombay\tAct  II of 1876 became unconstitutional\t under\tArt.\n13(1)  of the Constitution in that the procedure  prescribed\nby  s.\t13  of the Bombay Act II of 1876  in  respect  of  a\ndefaulter  residing  in the City of Bombay was\tharsher\t and\nmore  drastic than the procedure laid down in s. 157 of\t the\nBombay\tAct  V of 1879 in respect of  a\t defaulter  residing\noutside\t the City of Bombay was without force because s.  13\nof the Bombay Act II of 1876 was amended on 8th October 1954\nand  a new law laid down a law similar to the law laid\tdown\nby  s. 157 of the Bombay Act V of 1879 and thus the vice  of\nunconstitutionality 'if any' was removed.\nState  of  Punjab v.

Held, that the right sought to be acquired  by\nthe  petitioners  by  their several  purchases\twas  not  in\nrespect\t of  any future goods as claimed by them but  was  a\nlicense\t to enter on the land coupled with a grant to  catch\nand carry away the fish, in other words, a profit a  prendre\nwhich  is  immovable  property within  the  meaning  of\t the\nTransfer  of Property Act read with s. 3(25) of the  General\nClauses Act.

The appellant referred\nthe  dispute for arbitration to the Native Share  and  Stock\nBrokers'  Association in pursuance of an arbitration  clause\nin the contract notes.\tThe respondent refused to submit  to\narbitration  of\t the  association on  the  ground  that\t the\ncontract  notes\t were  void  and  therefore  no\t arbitration\nproceedings could be taken thereunder.\tThe arbitrators made\nan  award in favour of the appellant in the absence  of\t the\nrespondent  who\t declined to take part in  the\tproceedings.\nThe  respondent filed an application for setting  aside\t the\naward.\t The  Bombay High Court held that the  contracts  in\nquestion were not ready delivery contracts as defined in  s.\n3(4) of the Bombay Securities Contracts Control Act VIII  of\n1925  and that they were accordingly void under s. 6 of\t the\nAct and therefore the arbitration clause and the  proceeding\ntaken thereunder culminating in the award were also void.\nHeld  that apart from the question whether the contracts  in\nquestion  were for ready delivery or not, they were  outside\nthe purview of s. 6 of Bombay Act VIII of 1925 because\tthey\nwere not contracts for sale and purchase of securities.\t The\ndispute between the parties was as to whether the  appellant\nwas  acting  within  the  scope of  his\t authority  when  he\npurchased   the\t shares.   If  he  was\tacting\twithin\t his\nauthority,  the\t respondent  was liable to  him.

This Appeal is directed against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla in Letters Patent Appeal No. 108 of 1951 reversing the judgment of a single Judge of the High Court in Regular Second Appeal No. 942 of 1949 & dismissing the Appellant's suit with costs throughout.\n2. The suit out of which the present Appeal arises was instituted by the Appellant in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, First Class, Delhi, against the Respondents 1 & 2 for a declaration that he was the Mahant of the Temple of Bhaironji and as such entitled to the properties and the per-quisities attached thereto including the right to worship in the Temple of Sri Kalkaji and to recover the income from rents etc., as also from offerings and for other reliefs.\n3. The case of the Appellant was that one Baba Balak Nath was the Mahant of the Temple of Bhaironji and he left him surviving his three Chelas Sehaj Nath, Maya Nath and Sahib Nath. The pedigree showing the representation of these three lines of descent from Balak Nath is given below:\nOn the extinction of the line of Sehaj Nath, the estate and the right, title and interest of the last representative of that line devolved upon the surviving lines, viz., the lines of Sahib Nath & Maya Nath & Pancham Nath and Sandhiya Nath inherited the same in equal shares Pancham Nath was succeeded by his Chela Mam Chand Nath and after the death of Mam Chand Nath the Appellant, the other Chela of Pancham Nath and Gurbhai of the deceased succeeded to the estate of Pancham Nath Sandhiya Nath was succeeded by his Chela Shanker Nath.\nShanker Nath, however, was removed by the Bhekh Bara Panth on account of his immorality and Hardwari Nath, another Chela of Sandhiya Nath, was appointed the Mahant in his place. Hardwari Nath filed a suit in December 1941 against Shanker Nath which ended in a compromise decree, and, when Hardwari Nath tried to take possession of the property in pursuance of the decree, Shanker Nath murdered him and was, in his turn, sentenced to death on 18th April, 1943.\nBadlu Nath, another Chela of Sandhiya Nath and Gurbhai of Shanker Nath then succeeded to the estate of Sandhiya Nath. There was, however, a dispute in regard to the mutation of names between Badlu Nath and Respondent 1 who claimed to be the Chela of Phul Nath who was a Chela, of Naina Nath, an earlier representative of the line of Maya Nath.\nWhile this dispute was going on Badlu Nath died on 23-9-1945 without leaving any Chela with the result that the line of Maya Nath also became extinct and the estate and the right, title and interest of Badlu Nath, the last representative of that line, devolved upon the Appellant who was the representative of the surviving line of Sahib Nath.\nThe Appellant contended that respondent 1 was not entitled to succeed Badlu Nath and had no right, title or interest in the estate left by him. The rule of succession propounded by the Appellant was formulated by him in paragraphs 4 and 6 of the plaint as under:\n\"Para 4. Balak Nath, aforesaid, was Abdhut Jogi. Abdhut Jogis do not marry and according to law and custom succession devolves from 'Guru to Chela' and if one Chela does not survive, then it devolves upon the next one. In the same way, if a line becomes extinct and no Chela is left in that line then the Chelas of the remaining line inherit its share.\nPara 6. The rule of succession to the property left by Balak Nath is clear from the pedigree-table given hereof. Among all the three aforesaid lines according to custom and law succession devolved from a 'Guru' to a 'Chela', after the death of one Chela to the other Chela. But in case of extinction of a line and no Chela having been left therein succession devolved upon the remaining lines\".\nAfter setting out the custom as above, the Appellant gave in para 7 of the plaint an illustration of the extinction of a line, no Chela having been left therein and the consequent devolution of succession upon the remaining lines:--\n \"'Para, 7'. Bhola Nath, Chela of Shiv Nath co-sharer, died sonless that is without leaving a Chela. Accordingly Baba Sandhiya Nath and Baba Pancham Nath, proprietors of the other two lines, succeeded to one-third of the estate left by, the deceased as his heirs according to law & custom. Moreover vide order dated 19-4-1918, mutation in respect of succession to the deceased was sanctioned in favour of Baba Sandhiya Nath and Baba Pancham Nath in equal shares\".\n4. The Respondent 1 disputed this claim of the Appellant. The rule of succession was propounded by him in paragraph 4 of his written statement as under:--\n\"The Avdhut Jogis do not marry. Only the Chela who is nominated by Guru as his successor in his lifetime or in whose favour a will is made by the Guru and whose nomination is subsequently approved by the Bhek, becomes the Gaddi Nashin. If a Guru does not nominate his Chela as his successor, Bhekh Bara Panth appoints the successor of the deceased according to the custom prevailing in the Bhek.\nThe person so selected by the Bhek becomes the lawful heir and successor. A Chela has got no right to succeed merely on the ground of his being Chela. It is necessary according to the custom that he should be nominated by Guru and then his nomination be approved by the Bhek. Moreover a Guru Bhai (Co-disciple) has no right to succeed simply on the ground    of his being Guru Bhai\".\n5. The parties went to trial on the basis of these pleadings and the main contest between them turned on what was the rule of succession in regard to this institution. The trial court held that the custom set up by the Appellant was proved, viz., that the Gaddi of Bhaironji and the rights to Puja and to offerings in Mandir Kalkaji as well as the property attached to that institution, and the land in the village Bahapur devolved from 'Guru' to 'Chela'; in case there was no Chela, the Gurbhai of the last Mahant succeeded and if none of them was available and the line became extinct, the above rights devolved upon the surviving line.\nThe Appellant was accordingly found to be the rightful claimant to the Gaddi and rights and interests of Sandhiya Nath in both the above religious institutions and to lands in village Bahapur. The suit was, therefore, decreed in favour of the Appellant with costs.\n6. The Respondent 1 took an appeal to the Court of the District Judge, Delhi, and the District Judge, Delhi, accepted the conclusion of the trial Court in regard to the rule of succession, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the decree passed by the trial court in favour of the Appellant though it varied the order of costs ordering both the parties to bear their own costs in both the Courts.\nA second appeal was filed by Respondent 1 against this decision of the District Judge, Delhi, in the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla. This appeal was heard by a single Judge who also confirmed the decision of the trial court and dismissed the appeal with costs throughout. The Respondent 1 filed a Letters Patent appeal against this decision of the single Judge.\nThe Division Bench, hearing the Letters Patent appeal, came to a contrary conclusion, held that the Appellant had not proved the custom set up by him and allowed the appeal dismissing the Appellant's suit with costs throughout. This Appeal was filed by the Appellant against that decision of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla on a certificate granted by the High Court under Article 133 of the Constitution.\n7. The only point which arises for consideration before us is whether the Appellant has succeeded in proving the rule of succession propounded by him in the plaint.\n8. It may be observed at the outset that Respondent 1 failed to prove the rule of succession which he set out in para 4 of his written statement and the finding reached by the trial court, in this behalf that there has never been any election to the office of Mahant in these institutions was not challenged in the Court of the District Judge, Delhi, nor before the High Court.\nMr. Achhru Ram appearing before us for Respondent 1 also did not challenge that finding with the result that that contention must be taken as negatived. The Appellant has, however, got to succeed on the strength of his own title and not on the infirmity of that of Respondent 1 and he has, therefore, got to establish the rule of succession propounded by him in paras 4 and 6 of the plaint.\nThe elective principle having been negatived it can be safely assumed that the succession to the estate in these lines of descent from Balak Nath was hereditary and it devolved from 'Guru' to 'Chela'. As a matter of fact, the findings reached by the District Judge, Delhi, in regard to the succession in these three lines go to establish that the rule of succession was from 'Guru' to 'Chela'. The facts found by him were as under: --\n \"The really important evidence is of the actual facts of succession in these three lines. From the evidence that has been available it appears that in 1898 Agdi Nath who was in the line of Sahib Nath was succeeded by his Chela Ram Rikh Nath who in his turn was succeeded by his Chela Pancham Nath. In 1930 Pancham Nath surrendered the estate to his Chela Mam Chand Nath who died in 1943 and was succeeded by his Gurbhai Prithi Nath plaintiff.\nIn the line of Sehaj Nath the evidence shows that Sanwat Nath died in 1892 and was succeeded by his Chela Shiv Nath who died in 1910 and was succeeded by his Chela Bhola Nath. In 1918 Bhola Nath died without leaving a Chela. There was no Gurbhai of the previous Mahant either, nor any Chela of such Gurbhai and the line was taken to be extinct.\nIn the line of Maya Nath the evidence shows that Naina Nath died in 1866 and was succeeded by his Chela Roop Nath. He, however, absconded in 1897 and was succeeded by Misri Nath a Chela of his Gurbhai. Tulsi Nath who claimed to be Chela of Naina Nath disputed the succession and the matter went to court but was settled in favour of Misri Nath. He later died and was succeeded by his Chela Sandhiya Nath.\nIt would thus appear that in these lines either the Chela of the last Mahant or his Gurbhai or the Chela of the Gurbhai succeeded and no one more remotely connected with the last Mahant has ever succeeded\". These findings are sufficient to establish the first part of the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant, viz., that succession devolves from 'Guru' to 'Chela' and if one 'Chela' does not survive then it devolves upon the other 'Chela', meaning thereby the other Chela of the last Mahant who would thus be the 'Gurbhai' of the 'Chela' who died.\nThe succession would thus be in the line of descent from the last Mahant who was the representative of the particular line 'qua' whom it would be determined whether his Chela or Chelas succeed to his property. This position is supported by what happened in the case of succession to the property of Pancham Nath in the line of Sahib Nath.\nIt is also supported, apart from the alleged elective principle set up by Respondent 1, by what happened in regard to the succession to the property of Sandhiya Nath. Shankar Nath succeeded Sandhiya Nath but when he was removed from the Gaddi on account of his immorality, Hardwari Nath the other Chela succeeded to Sandhiya Nath and when Hardwari Nath was murdered, Badlu Nath still another Chela of Sandhiya Nath succeeded to these properties.\n9. What happens when a particular line becomes extinct has, however, been the subject-matter of divergent opinions between the two lower Courts and the High Court in Second Appeal on the one hand and the Letters Patent Bench on the other. All the three Courts who came to the conclusion in favour of the Appellant in this behalf were of the opinion that the extinction of the line of Sehaj Nath on the death of Bhola Nath afforded an instance of the second part of the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant, viz., that on the extinction of a line, no Chela having been left therein, Succession devolved upon the remaining lines.\nThe extinction of a line could take place only once and such occurrences would be very rare. Under these circumstances, even one instance of that type would be enough to establish the rule of succession as propounded. The only thing which weighed with the Letters Patent Bench in arriving at a contrary conclusion was the alleged admission made by the Advocate of the Appellant that\n \"as regards this part of the custom which he was propagating in respect of his client there was not a single instance and that in the course of the last 100 or more years since this temple came into existence there was no such occasion for such a custom which he was propounding to be in operation\"\nThere appears to have been some serious misapprehension in regard to this alleged admission. When the case of the Appellant in para 7 of his plaint was that on the death of Bhola Nath the line of Sehaj Nath became extinct, no Advocate could ever have admitted that there was no instance of any such extinction of the line and the devolution of succession, on the remaining lines ever to be found during the last 100 years.\nThe only line which became extinct was the line of Sehaj Nath, Maya Nath's line had continued right up to Sandhiya Nath and Badlu Nath, and one cannot understand this alleged admission unless on the assumption that there must have been some real misapprehension in regard to the same.\nThe Letters Patent Bench's finding against the Appellant rested mainly on the construction which it put on the wording of para 6 of the plaint and the Court was impressed by the fact that there was some confusion in the drafting of this paragraph and it did not accept the contention urged by the Advocate of the Appellant that that confusion was clarified in the other paragraphs of the plaint.\nThe Advocate for the Appellant explained that what was intended to be conveyed in that paragraph was that the extinction of the line meant the extinction only of a particular Chela to the last Mahant and it did not mean the extinction of all the Chelas in that line. The whole stress was laid on the words \"if there be no Chela in that line\".\nHaving regard to the finding reached by the trial Court which finding was not challenged by the Appellant before the District Judge, Delhi, or before the High Court that Respondent 1 was the Chela of Phul Nath who belonged to the line of Maya Nath, it came to the conclusion that there was a Chela in that line and, therefore, the line could not be extinct.\n10. We are, however, unable to accept this reasoning of the Letters Patent Bench. If the succession was from 'Guru' to 'Chela' and the question was whether a Chela or Chelas were in a position to succeed to the Guru, that question could be determined with reference to the position as it obtained at the time when the succession to the property of that Guru opened out and the only Chela or Chelas who could succeed to the property could be the Chelas of that Guru whose property was to devolve upon them.\nThe Chelas of any earlier Guru, whatever their spiritual affinity may be, could never be thought of in this connection. We are fortified in this conclusion by the events that happened in 1918. When Bhola Nath, the last representative of the line of Sehaj Nath died on 10th April, 1918, the only two persons who claimed to inherit his estate as on the extinction of his line and the devolution of succession to the surviving lines were Pancham Nath and Sandhiya Nath.\nPhul Nath, the Guru of Respondent 1 was then alive and if propinquity of relation ship in this spiritual descent which we are concerned with was the criterion of the right to inheritance, Phul Nath was certainly nearer in relationship than Sandhiya Nath and he could have claimed to inherit the property of Bhola Nath to the extent of the 1/2 share therein along with Pancham Nath.\nNo such claim was, however, made by Phul Nath and Sandhiya Nath, as the representative of the line of Maya Nath was the only person who made such claim for inheritance and was recognized as the heir of Bhola Nath along with Pancham Nath when mutation came to be made.\nThis goes to show that the succession from 'Guru' to 'Chela' only means the devolution of property from the last representative of the line to his Chela and when one talks of the succession from one Chela, on his death, to another Chela, it is also to another Chela of the Guru who is the last representative of the line. When one talks similarly of the extinction of the line, it only means that when the last representative of that particular line dies without leaving a Chela or Chelas or a Gurbhai who could succeed to his estate that line becomes extinct and one has not got to go backwards in order to ascertain whether there is any Chela of any Guru in that line at all surviving.\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that on the death of Sandhiya Nath, his Chelas Shanker Nath, Hardwari Nath and Badlu Nath succeeded to the properties left by him one after the other and that when Badlu Nath died there was neither his Chela or any Gurbhai of his who could succeed to the properties with the result that there was no succession possible in that line from 'Guru' to 'Chela' and the line became extinct.\n11. It was, however, urged by Mr. Achhru Ram that unless the Appellant proved that when Bhola Nath died on 10th April, 1918, there were Chelas existing in the line of Sehaj Nath & yet the line of Sehaj Nath was treated as extinct and the succession devolved upon Pancham Nath and Sandhiya Nath who represented the two surviving lines of Sahib Nath and Maya Nath, the second part of the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant could not be held proved.\nThe answer to this contention was furnished by the District Judge, Delhi in his judgment when he observed that it was admitted that Sehaj Nath had three Chelas and it was improbable that the other two Chelas who did not succeed had no Chela of their own; nor was it very probable that Sanwat Nath and Shiv Nath in turn had no other Chelas apart from their own who actually succeeded.\nThe evidence was that these Jogis had the habit of initiating several Chelas. Respondent 1 himself admitted that Naina Nath had as many as twenty Chelas and there was evidence of another witness also. It was, therefore, probable that the line of Sehaj Nath was taken to be extinct not because there was no Chela but because the last Mahant, i.e. Bhola Nath had no Chela of his own nor was any Gurbhai of his nor a Chela of a Gurbhai.\nAnother circumstance relied upon by the learned Dist. Judge in support of this position was that in the disputed line there were other Chelas actually living & one of them, Har Nath had given evidence as the witness of Respondent 1. He was the Chela of Misri Nath and thus nearer in spiritual relationship to the last Mahant than Respondent 1: yet Har Nath had never made any claim to the Gaddi that was now in dispute although if the case of Respondent 1 was well-founded Har Nath was entitled to the Gaddi in preference to him.\nThe reason could only have been that Har Nath knew that not being the Chela of the last Mahant nor the Chela of the Gurbhai he had no claim.\n12. We are in accord with this reasoning adopted by the learned District Judge and we endorse the conclusion to which he reached after taking all these factors into consideration that the rule of succession propounded on behalf of the Appellant was the rule of succession governing these institutions, i.e., a Mahant is succeeded by his Chela or his Gurbhai or the Chela of that Gurbhai and failing such claimants the line is deemed extinct and succession goes to the representative of the other line.\n13. This is sufficient to dispose of the Appeal and we need not discuss the other points which were adverted to in the judgment of the Letters Patent Bench. On a consideration of all the circumstances of the case we have come to the conclusion that there was no vagueness or indefiniteness in the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant in paras 4 and 6 of the plaint, that the custom propounded therein has been established by the Appellant and the conclusion which was reached by the Letters Patent Bench to the contrary was incorrect.\nWe accordingly allow the Appeal, set aside the judgment of the Letters Patent Bench and restore the decree passed by the trial Court in favour of the Appellant with costs payable by Respondent 1 throughout.\n"}, {"id": "611752", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "The State Of Madras And Another vs V.

This Appeal with special leave is directed against a judgment of the High Court of Mysore reversing the acquittal of the appellant by the Sessions Judge, Bangalore, on a charge under Section 302, Indian Penal Code.\n2. The appellant, accused No. 1, was charged that he, on the night of 9th March 1949, at about 10 p.m. in the village of Kodihalli, Kankanahalli Taluk, shot one Abdul Lateef Sab with a gun and caused his death and thus committed an offence under Section 302, Indian Penal Code. Accused No. 2 was his son and accused No. 3 his son's friend and the charge against them was that they were present and actively participated in the commission of that offence and were thus guilty under Section 302 read with Section 34, Indian Penal Code.\nThe learned Sessions Judge acquitted all the accused being of the opinion that the prosecution evidence was too insufficient to base a conviction thereupon. The State of Mysore took an appeal to the High Court and the High Court reversed the acquittal of accused No. 1 and convicted him of the offence with which he had been charged but in view of his old age coupled with peculiar circumstances of the case inflicted upon him a punishment of transportation for fife. The acquittal of the accused Nos. 2 and 3 was confirmed.\n3. There was very little direct evidence against the accused No. 1 but the prosecution relied upon circumstantial evidence which, according to it, pointed inevitably to the conclusion that the offence had been committed by him.\nThese circumstances were that there was ill-will between the accused No. 1 and the deceased, that the accused No. 1 wag seen by several disinterested witnesses at the time and the place of the incident, that immediately after the incident the accused No. 1 was seen running away from the spot, that he was absconding and did not make his appearance till three months later, that the deceased made a dying declaration though incomplete at about 11-45 p.m. the same day, about an hour and a half after the incident, that this dying declaration was corroborated by the evidence of P. W. 20 Range Gowda, P.Ws. 14, 15 and 16, that a rag, M.O. 5 which was said to be smelling of gun-powder, was picked up near about the hedga close to the scene of the incident and that' they all led to the conclusion that the deceased sustained an injury by a gun-shot and that shot was fired by the accused No. 1 that night.\n4. The learned Sessions Judge accepted the evidence in regard to the ill-will subsisting between the deceased and the accused No. 1 but was of the opinion that in cases of murder the motive for murder was in itself not sufficient though it may form one of the grounds.\nThe evidence of the witnesses was not felt by him to be conclusive enough to prove that the accused No. 1 must have shot the deceased and the dying declaration also was not considered by him as sufficient to base a conviction inasmuch as in his opinion that dying declaration had not been corroborated by any independent evidence. He was very much impressed by the fact that the gun itself which was alleged to have been used by the accused No. 1 was not traced, nor were any other articles used to shoot a gun beyond a small bit of cloth M.O. 5 said to have been smelling of gun-powder.\nThere was no evidence that the accused No. 1 had ever touched a gun in his lifetime or that he had the necessary skill, courage and capacity to shoot at the deceased from a distance of more than 4 to 6 feet behind a hedge and aim at him when he was moving on the road and thus shoot him accurately causing the injuries in question.\nThere was also the statement of the doctor who performed the post-mortem examination which showed that the injuries inflicted upon the person of the deceased proceeded from below upwards and in the absence of any evidence of a ballistic expert the learned Sessions Judge found it difficult to come to a conclusion that the accused No. 1 fired the shot from behind the hedge which was about three feet in height.\nHe thought that if the gun had been rested on the top of the hedge and fired from there the injuries inflicted would have only proceeded from above downwards and could not have been of the type found in the post-mortem examination. Under the circumstances, he thought that the evidence was too meagre and was insufficient to prove the offence against the accused No. 1 and further there was room for reasonable doubt for want of expert evidence in the case, the benefit of which should go to the accused No. 1.\nHe, therefore, disagreed with the unanimous opinion of the assessors that the accused No. 1 was guilty of the offence with which he had been charged and acquitted him.\n5. The High Court, in appeal, was of the contrary opinion. It believed the evidence of the witnesses who deposed to the events prior to the incident itself. P.W. 21 the elder brother of the accused No. 1, himself had said that all the accused had gathered in the house of the accused No. 1 on the morning of that day at about 10-30 a.m. and that the witness had overheard them saying that the deceased had to be murdered.\nAbout 7-30 p.m. the accused No. 1 was seen at the shop of P.W. 10 and at 8 p.m. he was seen moving towards the flour mill of the deceased by P.W. 16. He was further seen peeping into the mill premises at about 9 p.m. by P.W. 12. Besides this evidence in regard to the movements of the accused No. 1 at or near the place of the incident, there was the evidence of Range Gowda, P.W. 20, who was in the company of the deceased till he reached his own house. & who stated that he, all of a sudden, heard the report of a gun shot followed by the ery of the deceased \"Sattar shot me off....... I am ruined.....Please come Range Gowda\".\nRange Gowda then flashed his torchlight and proceeded towards the place where the deceased lay and while he was proceeding there he saw the accused No. 1 running towards the masjid with a gun in his hand. P.Ws. 18 and 19 stated that they heard the gun-shot and saw accused No. 1 immediately thereafter running towards the tank. The evidence of these witnesses was corroborated by P.Ws. 14, 15 and 16 who stated that the deceased shouted after the incident that Sattar had shot him.\nA piece of cloth, M.O. 5, said to be smelling of gun-powder was seen close to the scene of the incident. Cloth of this type was employed as a wad to secure the muzzle of a gun before the shot was fired from the gun. There was also the dying declaration of the deceased which, though incomplete due to the weakness of the deceased definitely stated that it was the accused No. 1 who had shot him with the gun.\nThe deceased further stated: \"I was going home. When I came near the house of Abdul Mazeed Sab Satar Sab shot me from the bush. He ran away. I saw\". The incident was put by him at 10-10 p.m. and he stated that it was a distance of 15 yards from which he must have been shot. When asked who was with him he stated that Range Gowda came in his company and that he stood near his house. This was the dying declaration and the dying man was in no condition to answer further questions.\nThe evidence of ill-will which was found as a fact even by the learned Sessions Judge, the evidence of these witnesses who were considered independent by the High Court and the statements in the dying declaration of the deceased corroborated as they were by the evidence of Range Gowda P.W. 20 and P.Ws. 14, 15 and 16 were considered sufficient by the High Court to come to the conclusion that the deceased was shot dead by the accused No. 1.\n6. The High Court also considered the nature of the injuries which were revealed in the post-mortem examination and negatived the contention urged on behalf of the accused No. 1 that the mosque ground wherefrom the accused No. 1 was said to have fired the gun-shot having been at a little higher level than that of the road on which the deceased was walking, the tracts of the injuries would naturally have run from above downwards and not Vice versa' as found in the post-mortem report. The High Court observed:\n\"It must be remembered that the hedge in that locality which is formed of the growth of lantana fence was found to have openings here and there according to P.W. 3 the Sub-Overseer, who prepared a sketch of the scene of occurrence.\nAs there is no evidence to show the exact position taken up by the assailant it is not impossible to conceive that the shot might have been directed in some posture through the crevices or openings in the lantana bush, so as to cause the injuries in question\".\n7. In regard to the absence of the ballistic expert's evidence, the High Court considered the argument as unrealistic and highly fanciful, observing :\n \"In the first place, it is not possible even for an expert to locate the exact position of the assailant and the victim at the time the shot was fired, and, in the second place, the distance of 15 yards from which the shot is proved to have been fired, sufficiently indicates the scattering of the pellets to answers the injuries in question\".\n8. Having regard, therefore, to the circumstances set out above, the High Court came to the conclusion that it was the accused No. 1 only who had been clearly established to have fired the gun-shot which resulted in the death of the deceased.\n9. It was urged before us by the learned counsel for the appellant that the High Court was not justified in upsetting the order of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions Judge and that there were no compelling reasons why it should have interfered with the findings reached by him. We do not accept this contention.\nThe learned Sessions Judge laid undue emphasis on the necessity of expert evidence in cases of gun-shot injuries and entertained a doubt which he characterised as a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused No. 1 in the absence of such evidence. He minimised the effect of the evidence of independent witnesses and considered the same meagre and insufficient to establish the guilt of the accused No. 1.\nEven though he admitted the dying declaration of the deceased in evidence he wrongly came to the conclusion that the same was not corroborated by any independent testimony. We are not satisfied that the learned Sessions Judge considered the evidence and the circumstances of the case in their proper perspective.\nWe are in accord with the reasoning of the learned Judges of the High Court who considered that the witnesses were independent, that there was sufficient corroboration of the dying declaration of the deceased in the testimony of Range Gowda, P.W. 20 and of P.Ws. 14, 15 and 16, and who, on an appreciation of all circumstances attendant upon the transaction, came to the conclusion that it was the accused No. 1 who was responsible for inflicting the gun-shot injuries on the person of the deceased. In our opinion, the High Court was perfectly justified in setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions Judge in favour of the accused No. 1.\n10. It was urged on behalf of the appellant that the injuries which were inflicted upon the person of the deceased were not gun-shot injuries. Reliance was placed upon a passage from Modi's Medical Jurisprudence, 10th Edn., page 210, where a distinction is made between gun-shot Wounds on the one hand and lacerated wounds, punctured wounds and incised wounds on the other and it was submitted that the wounds in the case before us were not gun-shot wounds but were either punctured wounds or incised wounds.\nNo such questions were, however, addressed in the cross-examination to the doctor who performed the post-mortem examination and the statements in his evidence: \"I was of opinion that the death was due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of gunshot wounds\" and \"all these injuries may be caused by a single shot\" stood unchallenged. We are of the opinion that, on the evidence as it stood, it was not open to the appellant ' to urge that ground before us.\n11. It was further urged on behalf of of the appellant that the dying declaration of the deceased was an incomplete document and, therefore, could not be used against him.\nReliance was placed on the observations of the Privy Council in -- Cyril Waugh v. The King', 54 Cal WN 503 at p. 507 (A), where their Lordships were of the opinion that \"the dying declaration was inadmissible because, on its face, it was incomplete and no one could tell what the deceased was about to add\" and also upon the observations of Mahajan, J., as he then was, in --'Ram Nath v. State of Madhya Pradesh', , that\n \"it was not sate to convict an accused person merely on the evidence of a dying declaration without further corroboration because such a statement is not made on oath and is not subject to cross-examination and because the maker of it might be mentally and physically in a state of confusion and might well be drawing upon his imagination while he was making the declaration\".\nWe are of the opinion that these observations do not help the appellant at all. In the dying declaration before us, even though the same was incomplete by reason of the deceased not being able to answer further questions in his then condition, the statement so far as they went to implicate the accused No. 1 in the affair were quite categoric in character and they definitely indicated that it was the accused No. 1 who had shot the deceased.\nThere was no question of any incomplete statement so far as that aspect of the case was concerned. The statement in regard to the accused No. 1 having shot the deceased was complete in itself and it could not be said that any further questions would have elicited any information which would run counter to the same. Under the circumstances, the dying declaration, though incomplete otherwise, was complete so far as the accused No. 1 having shot the deceased was concerned and could certainly be relied upon by the prosecution.\nThere was further the corroboration of the dying declaration in the evidence of Range Gowda, P.W. 20 and of P.Ws. 14, 15 and 16 and such corroboration invested the dying declaration with a stamp of truth which went a long way towards inculpating the accused No. 1.\n12. These were the only contentions which could, on the record, be urged before us on behalf of the appellant, and for the reasons given, none of them can be accepted.\n13. The result, therefore, is that the conviction and the sentence passed upon the appellant by the High Court will be confirmed and this appeal will stand dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "736323", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "Bhagwandas Gangasahai vs Union Of India & Ors on 11 October, 1955", "judgment": "           CASE NO.:\nWrit Petition (civil)  676 of 1954\n\nPETITIONER:\nBHAGWANDAS GANGASAHAI \n\nRESPONDENT:\nUNION OF INDIA & ORS. \n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 11/10/1955\n\nBENCH:\nS.R.

This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Hyderabad confirming the conviction under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and the death sentence of the appellant for having committed the murder of one Rami Reddy. He was also convicted under Section 307, Indian Penal Code for having attempted to murder P. W. 2, Venkata Reddy, and sentenced to seven years' rigorous imprisonment.\nHe has been charged and tried for having committed the said offences on the night of the 27th January, 1949, in a village called Alwal, Taluq Miryalguda, Nalgonda District. The case for the prosecution is that the appellant and one Narasimha Reddy along with three or four others alleged to be Communists, all dressed in uniform and armed with guns, came in a body to this village on the night of the 27th January, 1949, at about 10 p. m. and first got hold of one Narayana Reddy, abducted him and kept him in the precincts of the village and thereupon proceeded to the house of the deceased Rami Reddy to get hold of him.\nThe two leaders of the group, i. e., Narasimha Reddy and the appellant, got admission into the house of the deceased and into the neighbouring house of his brother, P. W. 1, by threatening the inmates and searched for the deceased and got hold of him from the terrace of the house of P. W. 1 where he was hiding. Meanwhile one Venkata Reddy, P. W. 2, a relation of one of the leaders of the group, Narasimha Reddy, carne on the scene having been sent for by the deceased when he found that the appellant and his associates were after him.\nThe appellant and Narasimha Reddy got hold of this P. W. 2 also and both of them were taken hand-in-hand by them towards the east of the house of the deceased. P. W. 1 as well as his mother, and P. W. 7, a brother of the deceased also accompanied them. While so proceeding they passed in front of the house of one Lachayya, from where the wife and two brothers of the previously abducted Narayana Reddy, viz., Narasamma P. W. 5; Govinda Reddy, P. W. 6; and Pratap Reddy, P. W. 4, were coming out.\nPratap Reddy and Govinda Reddy were interrogated by the appellant and his associate, Narasimha Reddy, and thereupon the appellant ordered Narasimha Reddy to fire. Narasimha Reddy in response thereto fired at the deceased Rami Reddy as well as at P. W. 2, Venkata Reddy. Rami Reddy died on the spot. Venkata Reddy escaped with a gun-shot wound into the house of Lachayya. Thereafter the party left the village.\nNone in the village stirred out of their houses that night. The dead body of Rami Reddy as well as that of the previously abducted person, Narayana Reddy, were found in the village next morning at about 5 A. M. The police came on the scene immediately and post-mortem examination and inquest were held. This was on the 28th January, 1949. First information report for the murder of these two persons was filed showing as the accused \"Narasimha Reddy and Adi Reddy, leaders, along with 150 Communist persons.\"\nInvestigation followed and a charge-sheet dated the 17th March, 1949, was submitted by P. W. 3, Inspector of Police. Meanwhile accused Narasimha Reddy died and the present appellant absconded. For some reason which does not appear clearly on the record, the committal proceedings were taken only in the year 1952. The appellant was committed to the Court of Session by order of the Munsif-Magistrate, Miryalguda, dated the 20th October, 1952.\n2. There can be no doubt that the deceased Rami Reddy of village Alwal died on the night of the 27th January, 1949, as a result of gun-shot wounds. This is shown by the inquest report and by the evidence of the Medical Officer who conducted the postmortem examination. (His evidence in the Committing Magistrate's Court has been marked as Ex. 3). This indeed is not disputed. Learned counsel for the appellant does not also dispute that there was a raid on this village that night by a party of Communists armed with guns.\nHis main argument is that what occurred was an armed conflict between a group of Communists and the police party, which admittedly was stationed in the village at the time, and that some of the villagers may have been present thereat and that the deceased Rami Reddy may have received gunshot wounds in the course of that conflict and died. It is urged that the police have foisted this case on the appellant since he was admittedly a Communist and that the villagers who now figure as eye-witnesses could all be persuaded by the police to speak against the appellant on account of their general hostility to the Communists.\nLearned counsel drew our attention to various features of the case as justifying the view put forward by him and leading to a serious doubt -- so it was contended-- as to the commission of the alleged offence by the appellant. Evidence of the eye-witnesses has been relied on as indicating the existence of an armed conflict between the police and the Communists that night at about the time when the murder is said to have taken place.\nIt is pointed out that the earliest version relating to this case as contained in the inquest report, while showing that some of the present eye-witnesses deposed about the incident before the Panches, does not specifically mention the name of this appellant as being in the party who abducted the deceased and murdered him. It is also said that even in the first information report which followed thereupon, the appellant was given only a subordinate position while in the present evidence he is given the leading position.\nIt is also urged that the first informant has not been traced or examined, that no formal post-mortem report has been exhibited or is available, that the material objects said to have been seized in the course of investigation have not been produced, that the night on which the occurrence took place was a dark one, that the appellant was not a resident of this village who could have been easily identified by the villagers, and that there was no previous identification parade.\nWhile some of these arguments may not be without force, they are all such as might well have been addressed to and considered by the two courts of fact which have dealt with the evidence. Some of these have in fact been dealt with and answered by the High Court. The details of the prosecution case and the part ascribed to this appellant have been clearly and categorically spoken to by six eye-witnesses, P. Ws. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7. They have been thoroughly cross-examined with reference to the various points suggested above.\nTheir evidence has been accepted by both the courts below. Though we have heard learned counsel for the appellant with reference to the above contentions and have been taken through, the evidence, we are of the opinion that this is not a case in which there is any substantial reason for departure from the normal practice of this Court not to disturb the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the courts below.\nWe cannot, therefore, entertain the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the case against the appellant has been concocted or that there is any serious doubt about the part ascribed to him by the prosecution evidence.\n3. Learned counsel for the appellant, however, urged some further points which call for consideration. It is urged that the High Court misread the evidence when it stated in its judgment \"when people began to collect, the accused directed another accused (who is now no more and said to have committed suicide) to shoot at deceased\". Admittedly, on the evidence it was the hand of Narasimha Reddy that shot the deceased.\nNow, it is true that none of the witnesses has stated that the direction of the appellant to Narasimha Reddy to fire was so specific as the learned Judges have assumed. The evidence of each and every one of the eye-witness is somewhat general. P. W. 1 said \"Then Adi Reddy ordered to open fire as people are collecting.\" P. W. 2 said \"Then Adi Reddy directed that people are now collecting 'Fire without further hesitation'. P. W. 4 said \"Adi Reddy then said that people are collecting. Let us fire.\"\nP. W. 5 said \"Thereupon Adi Reddy warned his comrades that people are collecting there. Let us fire\". P. W. 6 said \"Adi Reddy warned his men that people are collecting. Let us open fire\". P. W. 7 said \"Adi Reddy ordered to open fire\". In view of this evidence an argument has been advanced that what all Adi Reddy could have meant was, that some group of persons who were collecting were to be fired at and not either of the two persons, Rami Reddy or Venkata Reddy, who were being abducted.\nIt is urged that his comrade, Narasimha Reddy, may have misunderstood the directions of the appellant and that in such a situation the appellant cannot be held responsible if some person not intended by him was shot at and as a result died. Now apart from the question whether such a view is legally tenable or not, there is absolutely nothing to show that the appellant was in fact misunderstood by his comrade.\nThe argument has been presented as though there was a distinct group of people who were collecting at some distance and that it was they who were meant to be shot at. There is no such indication at all in the evidence. On the other hand the situation at the time when the direction was given as appears from the evidence is as follows. P. W. 2 Venkata Reddy stated thus:\n\"Then they dragged Rami Reddy and I out hand-in-hand. They abducted us through the street. Timma Reddy, Buchamma and Narain Reddy followed us. The procession went up to Lachia's house. There Partab Reddy, Govind Reddy and Narasamma came out of Lachia's house. Lachia is the father of Partab Reddy and Govind Reddy. Then Adi Reddy directed that people are now collecting 'Fire without further hesitation'.\nNarasimha Reddy stepped back and fired one shot at Rami Reddy behind the back. I cried out. He aimed another shot at me; but the bullet missed under my right armpit. I ran inside Lachia's house. Rami Reddy also attempted to escape. The dead accused throwing torch light broke three shots on him in all. The deceased collapsed on the spot. I ran out by Lachia's back door. Approximately five or six guns were carried by the party. Every one was holding a gun\".\nAll the other eye-witnesses substantially give the same story. The picture, therefore, as it emerges from this evidence is that from the house of the deceased the two persons, viz., the deceased and Venkata Reddy were being taken hand-in-hand by the appellant and his group towards Lachia's house. They were being followed by three persons, P. W. 1, his mother, and P. W. 7. At Lachayya's house, P. Ws. 4, 5 and 6 also came on the scene.\nThus the group hostile to the Communists (who at the time, according to the evidence, consisted of the two leaders, the appellant and Narasimha Reddy, with three or four others), swelled to a group of eight persons including the deceased and Venkata Reddy, who were being abducted. In the situation \"the people\" who were referred to as collecting would have been no other than this group. There is no indication in the evidence that any other persons in the village were collecting at the time or if so collecting were seen by the appellant in that dark night from a distance.\nThere can be, therefore, no reasonable doubt on the evidence that the appellant's direction to open fire must have been meant either as against the members of this group indiscriminately or as against the two persons who were being abducted. The fact that in that situation the appellant's comrade Narasimha Reddy spontaneously reacted to the direction by shooting at the two persons, viz., the deceased and P. W. 2 is some indication as to whom the appellant meant to be fired at.\nBut even otherwise, if his direction was a direction to fire indiscriminately as against the members of the hostile group consisting of the eight persons as above stated, the appellant would clearly be guilty if his direction brought about a shooting land death of any one or more out of these eight persons. There is, therefore, no substance in this contention ingeniously put forward by learned counsel for the appellant.\n4. The next point that has been urged is that the charge against the appellant is one of having directly committed the murder but that in fact what has been proved is no more than that he brought about the murder by instigating his comrade Narasimha Reddy to shoot. In this connection our attention is drawn to the fact that the Committing Magistrate in his order directing committal has specifically held that the offence of conspiracy under Section 120B, Indian Penal Code and that of unlawful assembly under Sections 145 and 148, Indian Penal Code were not made out.\nNow the actual charge on which this appellant has been committed to the Court of Session and on which without any amendment he was tried in the Sessions Court, is as follows:\n\"On or about the 27th January, 1949, you 'along with' Narasimha Reddy (since dead) abducted Rami Reddy, and murdered him by fire of gun shots and also fired on Venkat Reddy, who escaped. And you thereby committed the offence punishable under Sections 302 and 307, Indian Penal Code.) Learned counsel for the appellant says that this is really a charge of direct murder (1) against the 'appellant, and (2) against the deceased Narasimha Reddy. He urges that the evidence does not disclose any such direct commission of murder by the appellant. The wording of this charge, however, indicates that the abduction and murder are alleged to be the joint act of both. This is also confirmed by what the Committing Magistrate, who framed the charge, said in his order of committal as follows:\n\"Narasimha Reddy and Adi Reddy 'with common intention' have fired on Rami Reddy and murdered him.\" Though the Magistrate has not in terms referred to Section 34, Indian Penal Code in the charge, it appears reasonably clear that the charge was substantially one under Section 34, Indian Penal Code. Now, a mere direction from one person to another and the carrying out of that direction by the other may be only instigation of the latter's act and may not be a case of a joint act falling under Section 34, Indian Penal Code.\nBut where, as in this case, the two persons Adi Reddy and Narasimha Reddy, with their followers, all of them armed move about together for a set purpose and one gives instructions to the other and keeps himself on the spot in readiness to see it carried out and the other carries it out, it is hardly possible to say that the act is not one which was done in the furtherance of the common intention of both. (See -- 'Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. Emperor', AIR 1925 PC 1 at p. 6 (A)).\nIt is much more than a mere instigation to do the act. In this context it is also necessary to notice that out of the six eyewitnesses, three deposed to the fact that what the appellant said is \"people are collecting, let us fire\". This brings out the common intention clearly. But if the evidence makes out no more than mere instigation, it is, even so, instigation by a person who is present at the scene of offence when the act is committed. In such a case the instigator is \"deemed\" to commit the murder by virtue of Section 114, Indian Penal Code.\nAs pointed out by Lord Sumner in 'AIR 1925 PC 1 (A)', \"actual presence plus prior abetment can mean nothing else but participation.\" That is the irrebuttable presumption raised by Section 114, Indian Penal Code and brings the case under Section 34, Indian Penal Code. Thus in either view, we have no doubt that on the facts and evidence of this case the appellant is guilty of the offence of the murder of Rami Reddy and has been rightly convicted under Section 302, Indian Penal Code.\nIt follows that he has also been rightly convicted under Section 307, Indian Penal Code for attempting to murder P. W. 2, Venkata Reddy.\n5. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.\n6. The High Court while confirming the sentence of death has recommended that the Government might commute the sentence to one of transportation for life. We have not been informed whether that has been carried out or not and no argument has been advanced to us on the question of sentence. Nothing that we have said in our judgment is intended or meant to weaken the recommendation of the High Court in this behalf.\n"}, {"id": "1633791", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "Raja Bahadur Kamakshya ... vs The Collector And Deputy ... on 28 October, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nRAJA BAHADUR KAMAKSHYA NARAINSINGH AND OTHERS\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE  COLLECTOR\tAND DEPUTY COMMISSIONER\t OF  HAZARIBAGH\t AND\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n28/10/1955\n\nBENCH:\nIMAM, SYED JAFFER\nBENCH:\nIMAM, SYED JAFFER\nAIYAR, N.

The only question for determination in this appeal, by leave of the High Court of Judicature at Madras, is whether the transaction dated the 18th July 1934 is binding on the plaintiffs, respondents in this Court. It is not disputed that if that transaction characterised as a family arrangement and evidenced by Ex. D-1 is binding on the plaintiffs, the suit must fail, as held by the trial court in its judgment dated the 15th July 1943.\nIf, on the other hand, the transaction is not binding on the plaintiffs, the suit must stand decreed, as held by the High Court by its judgment dated the 19th December, 1946. The facts of this case may shortly be stated as follows :\n2. Rangaswami Iyengar, who died in 1894, and Doraiswami Iyengar, who died in 1948 and who was the first defendant in the suit giving rise to this appeal, were divided brothers. Rangaswami died leaving him surviving his widow Ranganayaki Ammal and his infant son Krishnaswami, who died in 1895-96 unmarried. Ranganayaki thus succeeded to her son's property as a limited owner. She held the property until her death on the 29th October 1933.\nShe was survived by her daughter Padmasani, who was married to Rajagopala Iyengar (P. W. 1). Padmasani died in July 1939 and was survived by her husband Rajagopal and two sons, who are the plaintiffs in the present action (respondents in this Court). Padmasani had two daughters also.\n3. In the meantime, the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, II of 1929 (which will be referred to hereinafter as \"the Act\") was passed by the Indian Legislature. It came into force on the 21st February 1929. As a result of this legislation, a son's daughter, daughter's daughter, sister and sister's son became entitled to succeed to the property of a Hindu male governed by the Mitakshara school, not held in co-parcenary and not disposed of by will.\nAll those specified heirs ranked in order of succession next after the father's father. At the time of Ranganayaki's death in October 1933 there was a diversity of judicial opinion in the different High Courts in India on the question whether the Act would apply to the property of a propositus who had died before the Act came into force.\nSo far as the opinion of the Madras High Court which governed the case in hand was concerned, a Division Bench of that Court had held in the case of --'Krishna Chettiar v. Manikkammal, AIR 1934 Mad 138 (A) that the Act did not apply to cases of Hindu males who had died intestate before the Act came into force. This decision was given on the 19th October 1933, that is to say, just ten days before the death of Ranganayaki.\nTaking advantage of this ruling of the Madras High Court, which differed from some other High Courts on the interpretation of the Act, Doraiswami, who was the uncle of the propositus Krishnaswami, took possession of his property soon after Ranganayaki's death. He appears to have taken legal advice on the question whether he or Padmasani, as the sister of the propositus, would have a preferential claim to the inheritance.\nHe was advised, on the strength of the decision aforesaid of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court, that he had a preferential claim. Naturally, Padmasani's husband Rajagopal was also moving in the matter and taking legal advice. He approached his brother's son Krishnaswami, an advocate practising at Kumbakonam, who was working as a junior to a well-known lawyer, Rao Bahadur N. Thiruvengadatha Iyengar, who appears to have been a very prominent citizen of the district, besides being a leading lawyer of the place.\nThe advocate Krishnaswami aforesaid, was related to his senior as the former had married the latter's brother's daughter. Rao Bahadur Thiruvengadatha Iyengar had an elder brother named N. Srinivasa Iyengar (D. W. 1), who appears to have been a prominent and influential inhabitant of the locality. Finding that Doraiswami aforesaid had taken possession of the property, Padmasani and her husband, who were rather in straitened circumstances, consulted the lawyers of Madras as to the legal position whether Padmasani, as the propositus' sister, could not claim the benefit of the Act in preference to the uncle Doraiswami.\nThey were advised that as a result of the decision of the Madras High Court supra, the uncle had a better right but that in any case the legal position was not free from doubt and difficulty and called for a settlement of the dispute out of court. On that advice Rajagopal on behalf of his wife Padmasani, with the help of advocate Krishnaswami aforesaid, approached N. Srinivasa Iyengar (D. W. 1) to intervene in the dispute between the relations and to bring about an amicable settlement; otherwise they would have to go to court if the negotiations for a compromise failed.\nDoraiswami was sent for by D. W. 1 and was told that Padmasani would have to go to court if the parties to the dispute did not settle it out of court. Doraiswami claimed that he was in rightful possession of the property of the propositus on the basis of the High Court's judgment. After weighing the pros and cons Doraiswami agreed to the suggestion of N. Srinivasa Iyengar to share the property with Padmasani and her children.\nHence towards the end of November 1933 Doraiswami agreed to give up half of the property for the benefit of Padmasani and her children and left the drafting of the document to the advocate Thiruvengadatha Iyengar. In order to pin him down to his promise, the said lawyer made a draft (Ex. P-1) which was signed by Doraiswami and was left in the custody of N. Srinivasa Iyengar, who was also put in charge of the moiety of the property proposed to be given away to Padmasani and her children.\nAs Ranganayaki had made certain alienations which were said to be not binding on the reversioners, it was decided that the draft of the transaction between the parties, would be finalised after recovering by negotiations, if possible, those properties which, had been alienated by Ranganayaki. One of those alienees was Natesa Iyer, an advocate, who realizing his position reconveyed a portion of the alienated property to Doraiswami.\nThese transactions also were entered into with the full cognizance and co-operation of Rajagopal, acting on behalf of his wife Padmasani, and their relation and lawyer Krishnaswami Iyengar. Those transactions were completed by January 1934.\n4. Padmasani's husband Rajagopal was financially in embarrassed position and had incurred debts on the occasion of his daughter's marriage, as also for the maintenance and education of his children, with the result that some decrees had been obtained against him and his \"own properties were in jeopardy. Hence when the settlement between the parties was finalised in the shape of Ex. D-1, dated the 18th July 1934, one portion of the inheritance was retained by Doraiswami for himself and the other portion was divided into two parts, one of , which was given to Padmasani in absolute right and the other to the infant sons, now the plaintiffs.\nThis was done with a view to facilitating the maintenance and education of the children and meeting the expenses of the daughter's nuptials. In the document as finally prepared the minor sons were represented by their mother as guardian in preference of their father Rajagopal, who should under the law have been the preferential guardian. This was done with a view to avoiding complications and in fear of the creditors of Rajagopal, though really it was the father who had carried on the negotiations and finalised the agreement.\nBy this arrangement Padmasani was allotted 10.16 acres of wet land and 5.75 acres of dry land and the sons were given 8.20 acres of wet land and 4.22 acres of dry land. The value of the properties retained by Doraiswami was said to be Rs. 5,000, equal to the value of the land allotted to Padmasani valued at Rs. 2,50,0 and to her sons valued likewise, though the area of the lands kept by Doraiswami was larger than that of the area gifted by him to Padmasani and her sons.\nThe document took the shape of \"the deed of arrangement or the deed of indenture\" executed between Doraiswami of the first part and Padmasani and her two minor sons, the present plaintiffs, under the guardianship of Padmasani of the second part. It proceeded on the basis that the entire properties mentioned in Schedules A, B and C td the deed were inherited by Doraiswami from the propositus and that the second party had no legal claim thereto but that out of love and affection for his deceased brother's daughter and daughter's sons he was making provision for their maintenance.\nThus, Schedule B properties were given to Padmasani with power of alienation and Schedule C properties in equal shares absolutely to the plaintiffs, Padmasani to remain in charge of the properties until the minors attained majority. Schedule A properties were to continue as before in the possession of Doraiswami as full owner.\n5. Both parties came in possession of their respective allotments & Padmasani, with the concurrence of her husband Rajagopal, alienated some of the properties which had been given to her in absolute right, for the purpose of meeting the expenses of maintenance and education of the children and the nuptials of the daughter. If the ruling of the Madras High Court in 'AIR 1934 Mad 138 (A)' had continued to be good law, perhaps no more would have been heard about the present dispute.\nBut on the 29th January 1937 'a Full Bench [Reported as, AIR 1937 Mad 699 (FB)] of the Madras High Court' overruled the earlier decision and on the 31st January 1937 a notice (Ex. D-2) was issued on behalf of the plaintiffs impugning the transaction evidenced by Ex. D-1 aforesaid.\n6. The present suit was commenced on the 16th July 1942 after the death of Padmasani in July 1939. The plaintiffs laid their claim for possession and mesne profits in respect of the properties left by their mother's brother and in possession of the defendants on the basis that they were the next reversioners after their mother's death, that the transaction of the 18th July 1934 was not binding upon them inasmuch as their mother was not a free agent in giving her consent to the arrangement which was vitiated by undue influence, that there was really no dispute, much less any bona fide dispute, which could have been amicably settled, nor was there any genuine and bona fide mediation.\nPadmasani's consent to the document was also assailed on the ground that she was not the legal guardian of the plaintiffs and had in interest adverse to theirs. Doraiswami was the 1st defendant in the suit. Defendants 2 to 27 were impleaded as alienees from the 1st defendant and defendants 28 to 39 and 41 as alienees from Ranganayaki and Padmasani.\n7. The suit was contested by the 1st defendant, whose daughter after his death is now the appellant before us. The defence was rested mainly on the ground that as the law was understood at the date of Ranganayaki's death he was the most preferential heir to the propositus and that he took possession claiming as such; that there was a threat of litigation on behalf of Padmasani, whose husband had been reduced to narrow straits and that the parties were brought together by their well-wishers and relations, mostly lawyers, and a 'bona fide' family arrangement was arrived at settling the dispute between the parties.\nThat transaction was reduced to the form of a document (Ex. D-1). It was also averred that the plaintiffs' father's family was financially in difficult circumstances and that the arrangement was considered by all the parties concerned as highly beneficial to the plaintiffs themselves. The allegations of undue influence and exercise of pressure on Padmasani were denied.\n8. The trial court dismissed the suit as between the plaintiffs and those defendants who had not compromised. It recorded certain compromises in respect of disputes between the plaintiffs & some of the alienees. The court found that the allegations of undue influence & coercion & that Padmasani and her husband Rajagopal were duped had been recklessly made and had no foundation even in the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs; that the family arrangement had been arrived at on a 'bona fide' settlement of a genuine dispute between the relations at the intervention of competent lawyers and good friends who were actuated solely by considerations of benefit to the family. Its conclusions can be summed up in its own words as follows:--\n \"So there were clearly rival claims, and a real family dispute, and a 'bona fide settlement thereof by respectable mediators, acting to the best of their lights and interested in both parties, and making a 'bona fide' settlement of the dispute with the consent of both sides, and their active participation in bringing about the result (by arranging the transaction with Mr. Natesa Ayyar), and both parties subsequently recognised, Ex. D-1 as such family settlement, and acted on such basis, Padmasani even reciting Ex. D-1 as a deed of family arrangement, till the date of the subsequent Full Bench decision, which gave a fresh idea to Mr. Jagannathachariar to advise a further claim\".\nOn appeal by the unsuccessful plaintiffs, a Division Bench of the High Court consisting of Wads worth and Govindarajachari JJ., substantially set aside the decision of the trial court and allowed the appeal with costs against the 1st defendant making further directions in respect of other defendants which it is not necessary to set out here. The High Court based its decision mainly on two considerations, (1) that the first arrangement evidenced by Ex. P-1 would have been a good settlement which in its terms was \"generous and equitable\"; and (2) that the interest of the plaintiffs who were both minors at the date the arrangement was actually arrived at, as evidenced by Ex. D-1, was sacrificed, keeping in view the fact that the law as ultimately laid down by the Full Bench ruling was entirely in favour of the plaintiff's claim.\n9. It has been argued on behalf of the appellant &, in our opinion, rightly, that the High Court has fallen into two fundamental errors, namely that it ignored the well settled legal position that the family arrangement had to be judged with reference to the events and the circumstances as they existed at the date of that transaction and not what actually emerged at a later date as a result of the judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court; and that secondly, it scrutinised the final arrangement as contained in Ex. D-1 with reference to the provisional arrangement as contained in Ex. P-1. The law was laid down by Romilly, M. R. in --'Lawton v. Campion', (1854) 18 Beav 87 (B) in these words :--\n \"The validity of a compromise or family arrangement of disputed rights depends on the facts existing at the time, and will not be affected by subsequent judicial determinations, showing the rights of parties to be different from what was supposed, or that one party had nothing to give up\".\nThat is the law in India also as laid down in innumerable decisions. Applying the test laid down in the dictum quoted above to the facts of the present case, it is manifest, as held by the trial court, that on the date of Ex. D-1 the 1st defendant was considered by competent lawyers to have been lawfully in possession of the property left by the propositus. Padmasani and her people were naturally disappointed and sought avenues of obtaining even a portion of the properties, desperately situated as they were.\nThe financial condition of Padmasani's family can best be described in their own words contained in a sale deed (Ex. D-11) dated the 23rd January 1939, to which Padmasani and the two plaintiffs of whom the first one had attained majority by then, were parties. In that document they admit as follows:--\n \"Since the husband of Padmasani Ammal, the individual No. 1 and the father of individuals Nos. 2 and 3, viz., Thuvar Rajagopala Iyengar, had no property whatsoever, the aforesaid Padmasani Ammal, with a view to meet the charges for the education and maintenance of her sons and to meet the family expenses of and the marriage, etc., expenses of Bhooma, her second daughter, the sister of the aforesaid Srinivasarangan and minor Narasimhan, and to redeem the jewels of Padmasani Ammal which were pledged with Sankara Ramanuja Nidhi, Big Street, Kumbakonam for meeting the expenses in respect of education and maintenance of the individuals Nos. 2 and 3 (plaintiffs) ....\". \nThus there is clear and cogent evidence of the fact that Padmasani, her husband and his family were in dire need of funds for maintaining the family, for educating the children and for meeting the marriage expenses of the girl. The High Court has well summed up the position in these words:--\n \"Seeing that the minors had no funds apart from their expectations and their mother and father were in straitened circumstances unlikely to be able to finance the necessary litigation, an arrangement which gave to the minors an absolute estate in nearly half the property on the income of which the whole family could live in comfort, was, in our opinion, generous and equitable.\" \nThen the learned Judges of the High Court compare and contrast the terms of Ex. P-1 with those of Ex. D-1 and lead themselves to the conclusion that in their anxiety to settle the dispute all the parties agreed to a modification of the original settlement, which modification amounted to sacrificing the interest of the minors in disregard of their rights in order to aggrandise Padmasani in so far as she was given an absolute interest in respect of a moiety of the moiety which had been conveyed by the 1st defendant to the plaintiffs and their mother.\n10. As already indicated, the learned Judges of the High Court have judged of the situation as it was after the judgment of the Full Bench of 1937 and not as it was in October 1933 when the dispute first began. If one starts with the supposition that the plaintiffs were the next reversioners, it is manifest that the 1st defendant had nothing to give and that his so-called gift evidenced by Ex. D-1 was a mere pretence.\nIf, on the other hand, we start with the hard fact that the 1st defendant was in possession of the estate on an assertion of a title which, as the law then stood, was a good claim, then the gift made by the 1st defendant to Padmasani in respect of about one-fourth of the entire estate and to the plaintiffs themselves in respect of another one-fourth of the estate approximately was A bounty to them.\nThere was the possibility of Padmasani and ultimately her sons getting the entire estate left by her brother, but that possibility was hedged round by a number of adverse circumstances. The 1st defendant had already taken possession of the estate and a litigation would have to be launched by Padmasani. Neither she nor her husband was in a position to finance that litigation.\nFurthermore, they would have to run the risk of litigation with all its uncertainties especially in view of the recent Bench decision of the High Court. Keeping in view the circumstances in which Padmasani and her family found themselves, they naturally appealed to the feelings of love and affection of the 1st defendant for his deceased brother's daughter and daughter's sons, through the unselfish efforts of the lawyers named above who were both competent and willing to render their services to mediate between them and the 1st defendant.\nThere cannot, therefore, be the least doubt that there was a genuine dispute between the parties which was sought by disinterested friends and relations to be settled by making the parties agree to give and take. So far as the 1st defendant was concerned, both according to Ex. P-1 and Ex. D-1 he took what both the courts below have agreed in holding to be a fair proportion of the properties in dispute. The courts below have disagreed on the portion given to Padmasani and her two sons, the plaintiffs.\nAccording to Ex. P-1, the entire property to be gifted by the 1st defendant was to come into the hands of Padmasani as a limited owner and ultimately to the plaintiffs as full owners. But by virtue of the arrangement actually arrived at between the parties (Ex. D-1), Padmasani got nearly half in absolute right and the other half was allotted to the plaintiffs.\nIt has been held by the High Court and it has been vehemently pressed before us by the learned counsel for the respondents that the arrangement thus arrived at was a device to vest Padmasani with absolute right in respect of about half the properties in which she could not have claimed anything more than the interest of a limited owner. That would be so, firstly, on the supposition that the 1st defendant was a trespasser and Secondly, on the supposition that Ex. P-1 represented a concluded bargain. That is not so.\n11. It is noteworthy that there is not a whisper in the plaint about the terms of Ex. P-1. It was for the first time in the High Court that the contention was seriously raised that with reference to the terms of Ex. P-1 those in Ex. D-1 were far too onerous to the plaintiffs. As already indicated the plaint proceeded on the basis that Ex. D-1 represented the final bargain between the parties -- a bargain which was vitiated by undue influence, coercion and deception.\nThat case, though laid in the plaint, completely failed for want of evidence in support thereof. The High Court failed to realise that the true situation was that the astute lawyers advising Padmasani and her husband were in a hurry to bind the 1st defendant by making him subscribe to a document drawn up by them. Hence they got the 1st defendant to sign Ex. P-1 which on the face of it was of a tentative character.\nThe other party to the transaction had not subscribed to it and the deed had not been delivered to her. She was therefore-free to go back upon it any time she chose, But she was the weaker party. At that point of time the 1st defendant was in a position of advantage. As certain alienations made by the limited owner in possession had to be negotiated for and settled to the satisfaction of the 1st defendant and Padmasani and her children, there was a delay of a few months.\nIf the 1st defendant had not been pinned down to some document, there was the danger of his backing out of his promise to share the inheritance with Padmasani and her sons. The document certainly achieved that objective. But it could not be said to have been a final and concluded bargain.\nDuring the Interval of about eight months that elapsed between the drawing up of Ex. P-1 and Ex. D-1 it appears that Padmasani's advisers realised that the terms of the original document, Ex. P-1, would be too onerous for Padmasani herself and not in the interest of the plaintiffs and other members of the family in view of the involved financial circumstances of the family.\nIt had been decided that the mother would figure as the guardian of her minor sons and not the father, who under the law would be the preferential guardian. The reason was that the legal advisers thought it advisable to keep the properties out of the hands of the plaintiffs' father who, as found by both the courts below, was fully cognisant of the entire negotiations and the terms which were ultimately given effect to.\nBut it was further realized that Padmasani would require funds for meeting the expenses of maintaining and educating her children and giving her daughter in marriage. If she was the mere guardian of her minor children, she would naturally face greater difficulties in raising funds for those purposes than if she were vested with the character of a full owner in respect of the moiety of the property agreed to be conveyed by the 1st defendant.\nThe High Court lost sight of the fact that by the revised terms the 1st defendant did not make any gain at all, the only modification being that the properties agreed to be conveyed by him to Padmasani and her sons were divided into two parts in one of which Padmasani was given an absolute right. It was not done to aggrandise her at the cost of her minor sons but in their own interest and in the interest of the rest of the family.\nIt was in those circumstances that the terms as originally proposed in Ex. P-1 were revised and took their final shape in Ex. D-1. It must therefore be held that Ex. P-1 was not, as the High Court erroneously assumed, a final agreement between the parties. The final agreement was as laid down in Ex. D-1. At the time the document was executed and registered, in view of the law as it then was understood as laid down by the Division Bench of the High Court, the 1st defendant was the true owner.\nHence there could be no question of sacrificing the interest of the minors for the benefit of their parents as distinct from that of the children themselves. The 1st defendant had agreed to part with a portion of the inheritance from the propositus not only to benefit the minors alone but also Padmasani. Padmasani apparently acting under the advice of her husband and of their friends and relations, particularly their lawyers aforesaid, agreed to the final terms as contained in Ex. D-1, not with any sordid motive of benefiting herself at the expense of her sons but in the interest of the family as a whole.\nNeither was the 1st defendant interested in advancing the cause of Padmasani at the expense of her sons. It is not correct, therefore, to suggest that any one, far less the parents of the minors, were acting against the latter's interest. The minors parents were immediately faced with the difficult problem of finding ways and means of maintaining the family, educating the children and giving the daughter in marriage, Those were matters in which everyone of them singly and collectively was equally interested.\nThe High Court, therefore, in our opinion misled itself into thinking that the interest of the minor had been sacrificed for the sake of the parents or one of them. The arrangement as finally incorporated in Ex. D-1 was conceived in the interest of the entire family of Padmasani and her husband and carried out under the advice of competent legal advisers who were not particularly interested in any one of the family as against the others.\nAs already indicated, that was not the basis of the claim as laid in the plaint. The plaint read as a whole assailed the arrangement on grounds which have completely failed in both the courts below.\n12. But it was argued by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs-respondents that in so far as Padmasani was vested with absolute powers in respect of the property given to her she was not acting in the interest of the estate of the minors and was, therefore, not representing them in that transaction, that she had no right to part with a portion of the properties for the payment of her husband's debts, that her powers were not coextensive with the powers of a daughter inheriting her father's property and that in law she had no right to alienate any portion of the properties.\nThese are arguments which are wholly irrelevant to the present controversy and proceed on the assumption that the compromise should have been made on the basis of the law as laid down by the Full Bench in January 1937. We have already held that the binding character of the transaction evidenced by Ex. D-1 has to be judged with reference to the state of affairs as it was at about the date of that transaction and not with reference to what the law was interpreted to be three years later.\n13. For the reasons aforesaid we must hold that the judgment of the trial court was correct and that the decision of the High Court was erroneous. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the suit dismissed with costs throughout as between the parties to this appeal.\n"}, {"id": "732276", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "Dajisaheb Mane And Others vs Shankar Rao Vithal Rao Maneand ... on 11 October, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nDAJISAHEB MANE AND OTHERS\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nSHANKAR RAO VITHAL RAO MANEAND ANOTHER.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n11/10/1955\n\nBENCH:\nAIYAR, N.

This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution which arises under the following circumstances. The petitioner, Sadhu Ram, purchased from one Imam-ud-Din, a Muslim evacuee, 43 Bighas 14 Biswas of agricultural land comprised in Khasra Nos. 2135 to 2139, 2158, 2159, 2171, 2204 and 2206 with Shamlat rights in village Kaithal, District Karnal, Punjab. The sale deed was executed on the 6th September, 1947, and registered on the 9th September, 1947, before Imam-ud-Din left for Pakistan. The consideration therefore was Rs. 3,000 and as much as Rs. 2,700 thereof appears to have been paid by the petitioner to the vendor before the Sub-Registrar. Possession also was transferred on the execution of the sale-deed. Mutation was made by the revenue authorities on the 23rd January, 1948. East Punjab Evacuees' (Administration of Property) Act, 1947 (East Punjab Act XIV of 1947) came into force on the 12th of December, 1947. It was amended by East Punjab Evacuees' (Administration of Property) (Amendment) Ordinance, 1948 (East Punjab Ordinance No. II of 1948) which came into force on the 16th January, 1948. This gave place to East Punjab Evacuees' (Administration of Property) (Amendment) Act, 1948 (East Punjab Act XXVI of 1948) which came into force on the 11th April, 1948. By these amendments a new section, section 5-A, was inserted in the East Punjab Act XIV of 1947. It will be seen that these amendments were subsequent to the date of the execution and registration of the sale-deed and the transfer of possession thereof. Section 5-A, so far as it is relevant for our present purpose, is in the following terms : \n\"5-A. (1) No sale, mortgage, pledge, lease, exchange or other transfer of any interest or right in or over any property made by an evacuee or by any person in anticipation of his becoming an evacuee, or by the agent, assign or attorney of the evacuee or such person on or after the fifteenth day of August, 1947, shall be, effective so as to confer any rights or remedies on the parties to such transfer or on any person claiming under them unless it is confirmed by the Custodian. \n(2) An application for confirming such transfer may be made by any person claiming thereunder or by any person lawfully authorised by him\".  \n2. This section purports to be retrospective. Hence an application for confirmation was made by the petitioner on the 23rd March, 1948. The Assistant Custodian, Karnal, on being satisfied about the genuineness of the transaction, recommended confirmation. But the Additional Custodian, Jullundur, by his order dated the 11th February, 1953, rejected the application for confirmation acting on the Custodian-General's circular dated the 9th March, 1950, under which a policy of not confirming transactions relating to agricultural property was enunciated. This was affirmed by the Assistant Custodian-General on an application to him for revision. \n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the fact that his transaction which, on enquiry, was held to be genuine, was entered into before the East Punjab Act XIV of 1947 was enacted and before the amendment thereof by insertion of section 5-A came into operation. He contends that the retrospective operation of section 5-A in such circumstances amounts to deprivation of his property, without any compensation and is, therefore, hit by article 31 of the Constitution. Whatever may have been the position if this matter had to be dealt with much earlier, it seems doubtful whether any such contention can be raised by the petitioner before us, on this date, in view of the recent Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, which has come into force on the 27th April, 1955. It is unnecessary, however, to base our decision on this ground. \n4. It appears to us clear that section 5-A cannot be read as a legislative provision depriving the owner of his property. There can be no doubt that so far as transactions subsequent to the date of amendment are concerned, it is nothing more than a restriction on the transfer of property by the owner thereof. Any transferee in such a situation takes the property subject to the requirement of confirmation. The case would, then, be one which falls under article 19 of the Constitution and not under article 31. There can be no doubt that having regard to the purpose and policy underlying the law relating to Evacuee Property and the abnormal conditions which arose from and after the 15th August, 1947, the requirement of confirmation with reference to transactions affecting Evacuee Property cannot but be considered a reasonable restriction. If this requirement was in essence not a deprivation but a restriction in respect of future transaction, there is no reason for treating it as deprivation by virtue of its having been given retrospective effect, such retrospectivity being within the competence of the appropriate legislature. The retrospectivity commencing from the 15th August, 1947, is also not only reasonable but called for in the circumstances, which occasioned the Evacuee Property laws. In this case the petitioner is deprived of his bargain and incurs consequential loss, not by virtue of any unconstitutional law but by reason of the quasi-judicial order of the Custodian declining to confirm the transaction. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that any fundamental right of his has been violated must, therefore, be rejected. \n5. Learned counsel next urges that the action of the Custodian in basing his decision on some circular of the Custodian-General is illegal and that it is not relevant material under section 5-A. It is enough to say that even if this contention be correct, this does not raise any question of violation of fundamental rights. If this is the sole ground, this application is misconceived. \n6. This petition accordingly fails and is dismissed but in the circumstances without costs. \n"}, {"id": "193318234", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "Bhagwandas Gangasahai vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. ... on 11 October, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

These two petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution have been heard together as the question for decision is the same in both of them. It is claimed by the petitioners that their fundamental rights had been infringed by the leasing out of an area of land in Abu Road Taluka to Messrs Jeewan and Sons, Respondent No. 3. for a term of 20 years whereby the latter were permitted to excavate lime-stone.\nThis was done without inviting any application or tender for the same or the holding of any auction and without notice to the public or to any lime-stone merchants or railway contractors. The petitioners had been excavating lime-stone for many years in Abu Road Taluka previous to the aforesaid lease. They had also leases for limekilns for lime burning for the past 10 years. They were informed that they would not be granted permission to excavate lime-stone nor would their leases for their lime-kilns be renewed but would be allotted suitable lands from certain survey numbers from Akra village.\n2. On behalf of the petitioners it was contended that by the granting of the lease to Respondent No. 3 a monopoly was created, it was further contended that during the pendency of their lease for the lime-kilns they were served with peremptory notice directing them to close their lime-kilns within 24 hours, and that by this action of the Government their fundamental rights to hold property and carry on their business had been violated.\n3. It is difficult to comprehend, having regard to the facts, how any fundamental rights of the petitioners had been infringed by the granting of the above-mentioned lease to Respondent No. 3. The area ultimately leased to Respondent No. 3 contains no portion which was previously in the lease of the petitioners. The Government as owners of the land with its minerals was 'prima facie' entitled to lease it out to Respondent No. 3 and the petitioners have been unable to show under what authority of law they had a right to have that area leased out to them instead of Respondent No. 3. The action of the Government in granting the lease to Respondent No. 3 cannot in the circumstances of the case be regarded as one by which monopoly of lime-stone business was given to Respondent No. 3, as contended on behalf of the petitioners.\n4. It was, however, said that the lease granted to Respondent No. 3 was illegal being contrary to the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (Central Act No. LIII of 1948) (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the Rules framed thereunder, namely, the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949. It was pointed out that section 4 of the Act prohibits the granting of a mining lease otherwise than in accordance with the Rules made thereunder and any such lease granted contrary to the provisions of the Act was void and of no effect.\nThe Mineral Concession Rules, 1949 define what is \"minor mineral\" and this expression means \"building stone, boulder shingle, gravel, lime-stone and kankar used for lime burning, murrum, brick-earth, ordinary clay, ordinary sand, and road metal\". Rule 4 of these Rules states that they shall not apply to minor minerals, the extraction of which shall be regulated by such rules as the Provincial Government may prescribe. It may be stated that when the lease in question was granted, no Rules had been framed by the Government of Bombay.\nThe Rules framed by the Government of Bombay came into existence in 1955 and we are not concerned with them. Mr. Anthony for the petitioners contended that as lime-stone is a \"minor mineral\", although the lease in question is said to have been granted under Rule 26, it could not have been so granted because the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949 did not apply to such a lease. There being no Rules framed by the Bombay Government under the provisions of the Act, the lease had been granted in contravention of the express provisions of Section 4 of the Act and, therefore, was void and of no effect. The action of the Government in granting the lease was illegal and as it infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioners, the petitioners were entitled to ask this Court to issue a writ in the nature of 'mandamus'.\n5. As already observed we are unable to see what fundamental right of the petitioners had been infringed. Assuming the action of the Government in granting the lease was illegal, a petition for a writ under Article 32 of the Constitution is not maintainable unless there has been a violation of some fundamental right. An examination of the terms of the lease, however, would show that it does not come within the definition of \"minor mineral\" as given in the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949.\nThe lease states that it is a mining lease concerning lime-stone only. The lease does not speak of lime-stone to be used for lime burning. The use of lime-stone can be for other purposes than lime burning and there is no justification on the materials on the record, for the suggestion made on behalf of the petitioners that the lime-stone is only used for lime burning. Since there is nothing in the lease to show that it was with reference to a minor mineral, the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949 apply to it and the action of the Government in granting the lease cannot be said to be illegal.\n6. It was next contended that as the petitioners had been directed to close their lime-kilns during the pendency of their lease without any justification, there had been a violation of their fundamental rights and they were entitled to ask for a writ under Article 32 of the Constitution. According to the petitioners themselves the term of their lease was extended up to the 31st of July, 1955 and to-day there is no lease in existence in their favour.\nWhatever cause of action the petitioners may have by way of damages or otherwise for the alleged improper action of the Government the present petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution become infructuous so far as this aspect of the case is concerned. It is, however, necessary to point out that the respondents do not admit that in fact the petitioners had any lease at all. According to the respondents the petitioners were mere licencees.\nOn behalf of the petitioners no document of lease or in the nature of a lease has been produced. Reference was made to Ex. 'R' Annex. 2 in Petition No. 676 of 1954 This document, however, far from showing any lease in favour of the petitioners, indicates that the petitioners were regarded as licencees. In paragraph 4 of this document the word lease' is used; but the opening paragraph of the document clearly shows that the petitioners, Bhagwandas Gangasahai, Lime Merchants, were seeking permission to make non-agricultural use of survey No. 230 of Morthalla of Abu Road Taluka and that the Mamlatdar was informing the merchants that the permission asked for had been granted.\nIt is difficult in these circumstances to come to any definite conclusion that the petitioners had a lease of the lime-kiln and that they were not licencees. In any event even if there was a lease it had come to an end after the 31st of July, 1955 and the petitioners have failed to show that they had any right to have it renewed. Mr. Anthony urged that the practice in the past had been to renew the lease and in paragraph 4 of Ex. 'R' it was clearly stated that the merchant will have to apply, before the expiry for renewal.\nParagraph 4 merely states that the merchant will give up possession of the land on the expiry of the lease or he will have to apply for renewal before the expiry of the lease. Nothing stated in this paragraph establishes that the petitioners had a right to have the lease renewed or that a guarantee had been given to the petitioners that the lease would be renewed.\n7. These petitions are accordingly dismissed with two sets of costs. One set of costs will be paid to Respondent No. 3, Messrs Jeewan and Sons and the other set of costs to Respondents 1, 2 and 4.\n"}, {"id": "558586", "date": "10/1955", "tagline": "Sadhu Ram vs The Custodian-General Of ... on 28 October, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nSADHU RAM\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE CUSTODIAN-GENERAL OF EVACUEEPROPERTY.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n28/10/1955\n\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nBENCH:\nJAGANNADHADAS, B.\nAIYAR, N.

This is an appeal with special leave by Pritam Singh, son of Surain Singh, hereinafter called Pritam Singh Fatehpuri, and Pritam Singh, son of Ladha Singh, hereinafter called Pritam Singh Lohara, against their conviction and the sentence of death passed upon them by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, and confirmed by the High Court of Punjab at Simla.\n2. Both the appellants were charged that they, along with Kartar Singh alias Mal and Gurdial Singh alias Karnail Singh absconding, on 2-5-1953, in furtherance of the common intention of them all committed the murders of Chanan Singh Orara and Sardul Singh by shooting them with firearms.\n3. The story unfolded in the evidence led by the prosecution was that, at about 6 p.m. on 2-5-1953, Pritam Singh Lohara and Kartar Singh got into Lorry No. P. N. A.--2404 at the bus stand at Amritsar. Chanan Singh Orara and his nephew Sardul Singh also travelled in this lorry.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri and Gurdial Singh got into the lorry on the way and seated themselves with Pritam Singh Lohara and Kartar Singh in the seats which had been already reserved for them by the latter. When the lorry neared the village Bohoru, the driver stopped the lorry on being asked to do so and the two Pritam Singhs and both the absconders got down from the lorry.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri and Gurdial Singh stood on the right flank of the lorry nearest to the seat on which Chanan Singh was sitting on the front-row of seats just behind the driver while Pritam Singh Lohara and Kartar Singh went over the left flank next to Sardul Singh. All the four whipped out small firearms.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri and Gurdial Singh fired at Chanan Singh while Pritam Singh Lohara and Kartar Singh fired at Sardul Singh with their respective firearms and both the victims died on the spot. Sardul Singh had a rifle, Ex. P-14 with him which was a licenced one and belonged to Chanan Singh Orara who had given it over to Sardul Singh for carrying it on the journey.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri caught hold of this rifle. Chanan Singh Orara had a licenced revolver Ex. P-56 hung round his neck and Pritam Singh Lohara removed this revolver. All the four culprits then ran away towards the canal side. They met four cyclists on the wav and relieved them of their cycles in order to hasten their retreat from the spot. The culprits subsequently abandoned these cycles at odd places and made themselves scarce.\n4. The driver of the lorry was Pritam Singh, son of Maqsudan Singh. He went to the police station Saddar Amritsar and made the report at 7-45 p.m. that day. Shri Om Prakash the S.H.O., reached the spot at 8-30 p.m. and entered upon the investigation of the offence and recorded the statements of various passengers in the lorry who were on the spot.\nAmongst the passengers so examined was a police constable, one Thakar Singh, who gave the clue to the identity of one of the culprits. 8 foot-prints were found in a field near the spot and the moulds of these foot-prints were taken on 3-5-1953. On the same day, moulds of 4 foot-prints in a field near the canal bank at some distance from the spot were also taken.\nThe identity of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri became known at about noon on 3-5-1953 and his house in Kaulsar in Amritsar City was raided at about 3-30 p.m. that day. Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was not there and his house was locked. The lock was broke open and a search of his house was made in the presence of witnesses. A bush-shirt, Ex. P-34, was found hanging on a peg in the house while a pair of shoes, Ex. P-29, were found laying on the floor. The bush-shirt was blood-stained.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri could not be found in spite of search at all likely places and proceedings under Sections 87/88, Criminal P. C. were taken against him. On 26-5-1953, Shri Om Prakash received information about the whereabouts of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and picketed a place on the Ganda Nala in the village area of Gumanapura on the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri was seen coming at about 3 p.m. from the side of village Gumanpura and was intercepted and caught. He had on him a rifle, Ex. P-14, slung round his shoulder. This rifle along with 15 cartridges in his dab were seized and a memo of recovery was made which was witnessed, amongst others, by Sohan Singh, P.W. 47 and Milka Singh, P.W. 46.\n5. An identification parade relating to Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was held in the District Jail at Amritsar on 29-5-1953 by Shri K.K. Puri, then Magistrate First Class, Amritsar. The accused refused to be identified by police constables Thakar Singh and Raj Pal Singh on the ground that Thakar Singh was his enemy and he had been shown to the witnesses already. Of the other witnesses, Gurdip Singh identified the accused as one of the culprits who murdered the two deceased while Dial Singh picked him out as one of the two men who had stopped the lorry at the railway crossing.    No   other witness  called at the parade could identify him correctly.\n6. Another identification parade relating to Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was held by Shri M. Isa Das, Magistrate First Class, Amritsar, on 6-6-1953 in the District Jail at Amritsar. None of the witnesses, however, could identify the accused in the parade.\n7. Pritam Singh Lohara was arrested on 9-6-1953 at Faridkot and was sent to the Faridkot Jail on the same day. He was interrogated there by Shri Om Prakash on 22-6-1953 and he disclosed that he had buried two revolvers wrapped in a bush-shirt and contained in a tin by the side of a bush in the vicinity of village Dipsinghwala.\nThis statement of his was reduced to writing and he then led the police party to a field in the village area of Dipsinghwala where he pointed out a place by the side of a bush and dug out therefrom a tin, Ex. P-57, which was found to contain the revolvers, Ex. P-48 and P-56, wrapped up in a bush-shirt.\nThe articles recovered were taken into possession. A separate case under the Arms Act was registered in Faridkot against him in respect of these recoveries. The learned Magistrate, First Class, Faridkot, convicted him under Section 19 (f), Arms Act. This conviction was, however, set aside by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, and he was acquitted of the charge leveled against him.\n8. On 17-6-1953, an identification parade was held in the District Jail at Faridkot relating to Pritam Singh Lohara. Before the identification parade started, the accused stated that he should not be made to walk during the identification proceedings. 16 witnesses were called, one by one, to pick out the accused from the row in which he and his 12 companions in the parade were made to sit. Out of these, 11 identified the accused correctly but the others failed to do so.\n9. On the same day another parade was held in the District Jail, Faridkot, for the identification of the foot-prints of Pritam Singh Lohara. The accused was made to walk with four other men, selected by the accused himself from the inmates of the jail, on a specially prepared sandy ground inside the jail.\nThe accused and his companions in the parade were made to walk with shoes on. Sohan Singh tracker and Sajjan Singh tracker were asked to identify the foot-prints of the accused and they identified the foot-prints of the accused correctly as the foot-prints of one of the four culprits which they had seen near the spot near village Bohoru.\n10. The bush-shirt, Ex. P-34, was sent to the Chemical Examiner and the Serologist, and, according to their reports, it was found stained with human blood.\n11. The prosecution led the evidence of some of the passengers who had travelled by the lorry in question. They also examined Pritam Singh, son of Maqsudan Singh, who was the driver of the lorry. They were all eye-witnesses of the occurrence. Out of these witnesses, Thakar Singh, P. W. 1 and Raj Pal P. W. 2, were police constables who were going to Jhabal in the same lorry in plain clothes.\nDial Singh, son of Chanan Singh Orara, also was examined and he deposed that Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Gurdial Singh had stopped his lorry in order to get in but had allowed the lorry to proceed further when they did not find their companions travelling in the same.\nPritam Singh, the driver of the lorry, turned hostile and had to be cross-examined by the prosecution. He had given the description of the culprits in the F.I.R. but did mot identify Pritam Singh Fatehpuri in the identification parade which was held in the District Jail at Amritsar on 29-5-1953. He also deposed that the witnesses who had identified Pritam Singh Lohara at Faridkot had gone to Faridkot two days before the identification parade and Shri Om Prakash had shown him in the Deorhi of the jail to the witnesses before the parade.\nIn view of this attitude of the witness the Court looked at the description given by him of the culprits in the F.I.R. and on a comparison of the description with the accused in the dock before it, it came to the conclusion that one of the descriptions fitted Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and thus was sufficient to identify him, observing:\n \"Anyhow, the description given in the First Information Report is by far more apt than inapt in its application to Pritam Singh Fatehpuri accused'.\nIn regard to the shoes, Ex. P-29 also, Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was asked in his examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C. whether the shoes belonged to him and what happened thereafter can best be described in the form of questions and answers therein recorded:--\n\"Q. Do the pair of shoes Ex. P-29 and the bush-shirt Ex. P-34 belong to you?\nA. No. I have never worn them.\nQ. Do the shoes Ex. P-29 fit your feet?\nA. I do not know.\nQ. Are you prepared to show whether they fit your feet?\nA. Yes. \"The accused has just put on the pair of shoes Ex. P-29 in Court. (The accused complains that the shoes are too tight for his feet, but to all appearance they quite fit his feet).\"\n12. As regards Pritam Singh Lohara also, the learned Additional Sessions Judge made him walk before him and observed that when he was made to walk he walked with a distinct limp although on previous occasions this limp was very much less marked and he was of the opinion that ordinarily the limp was slight.\nThe description of Pritam Singh Lohara as given in the F.I.R. was also considered enough apart from the evidence of other witnesses to fix the identity of this accused as being one of the murderers who took part in the murders of Chanan Singh Orara and Sardul Singh.\n13. Having regard to the evidence of eye-witnesses supported as it was by the evidence of identification, foot-prints, recoveries and the circumstances of both the Pritam Singhs having absconded after the occurrence, the learned Additional Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that the guilt of both the Pritam Singhs was established.\nThe three assessors who had aided in the trial were also unanimous in their opinion that both the accused were guilty of the murders and the learned Additional Sessions Judge accordingly convicted both of them of the offences with which they had been charged and sentenced them to death subject to confirmation by the High Court.\n14. The High Court scrutinised the whole of the evidence and considered the various criticisms which were leveled against it by the learned counsel for the accused. So far as Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was concerned, it marshalled the evidence and divided it into 6 categories:\n(1) Identification.\n(2) Recovery of a revolver from his safe kept in his house along with other things which he admits to belong to him.\n(3) Recovery of a rifle taken from Sardul Singh deceased.\n(4) Track evidence.\n(5) Finding of a bush-shirt; and\n \n\n(6) His absconding.\nThe identification evidence suffered from the disability that out of as many as 16 witnesses who were present at the identification parade held on 29-5-1953, barring the two constables who were refused by the accused, only two, viz., Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh identified the accused, and out of the 5 witnesses who were present at the identification parade held on 6-6-1953 none was able to identify him. Even so, the High Court considered that the identification by Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh was satisfactory and relied upon the same though it observed:\n\"If this was the only piece of evidence perhaps it would have been unsafe to convict as standing by itself it might not have been sufficient, but as I shall show later there are other pieces of evidence which go to support the case for the prosecution\". It further observed:\n\"In any case, I am satisfied that the identification was carried out in a very straightforward manner and identification by Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh cannot be rejected as being either casual or as a result of mere change\".\nThe recovery of the bush-shirt and the shoes from the house of the accused was also held proved by the evidence of the search witnesses and the bush-shirt Ex. P-34 with stains of human blood upon it was treated as a, further corroboration of the participation of the accused in the offence.\nThe rifle Ex. P-14 taken from Sardul Singh deceased was held to have been found upon the person of the accused when he was arrested on the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953 and the evidence of the search witnesses Milka Singh P. W. 46 and Sohan Singh P. W. 47 was accepted by the High Court even though they were criticised as stock witnesses who always were at the beck and call of the police and helped them in various raids and searches carried out by him.\nThe track evidence also was found sufficient to connect the accused with the crime inasmuch as the shoes found in his house were held to belong to him and the moulds of the foot-prints taken on the spot tallied with the impressions made by those shoes. Those shoes were moreover taken to have fitted the accused having regard to the observation made by the learned Additional Sessions Judge when examining the accused under Section 342, Criminal P. C. The case against Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was thus summed up by the High Court:\n\"Thus the evidence against Pritam Singh Fatehpuri which in my opinion has been established is:\n\"(1) Foot-prints were found at the spot which correspond to a pair of shoes which fits him and which was recovered from his house along with some other articles which he claims to be his although he gives a different explanation which I have not accepted;\n(2) A blood-stained shirt was found from his house;\n(3) He was found absconding and when arrested there was found on his the rifle which was being carried by Sardul Singh deceased, but there is no explanation as to how he came into possession of this article.\nThere is besides this the evidence of identification by one of the passengers of the bus in which he travelled and in which the deceased were travelling and of two constables whose names no doubt do not figure in the First Information Report but who state on oath that they were in the bus and by cross-examination it has not been shown that this statement of theirs is false. Besides this, the description which was given on the First Information Report of this accused does according to the learned trial Judge fit him. I would, therefore, hold that Pritam Singh Fatehpuri accused has been rightly convicted\".\n15. So far as Pritam Singh Lohara was concerned, the High Court grouped the evidence against him into 5 categories:\n(1) Eye-witnesses\n \n\n(2) Witnesses of identification\n \n\n(3) Foot-prints\n \n\n(4) Recovery of a revolver; and\n \n\n(5) Absconding.\nThe eye-witnesses including the police constables Thakar Singh and Raj Pal were believed by the High Court in spite of the criticisms leveled against them by the counsel for the accused. The identification evidence had been characterised as got up, the accused having alleged that, before the identification parade was held, he was shown by Shri Om Prakash to the witnesses in the Deorhi of Faridkot Jail.\nAs many as 11 witnesses out of the 16 who were present at the identification parade had identified the accused and it was alleged that most of them looked closely at the face of the accused for some time before they were able to identify him and obviously they were looking for some mark of identification on the face which had been communicated to them by Shri Om Prakash before they could identify him.\nAll these criticisms, were considered by the High Court and in spite of the same the High Court came to the conclusion that the identification evidence was satisfactory and could be relied upon. The track evidence was also relied upon by the High Court having regard to the fact that the shoes which had been supplied to the accused in the District Jail when the accused was made to walk there on a sandy patch specially prepared for the purpose created impressions which tallied with the moulds of the. foot-prints prepared on the spot.\nThe limp in the gait of the accused had created impressions which were particularly characteristic of this accused and the High Court was of the opinion that the tracks which were picked up on the spot were the tracks of Pritam Singh Lohara and that went to corroborate the story of the prosecution as to the complicity of the accused in the murders.\nIn regard to the recovery of Ex. P-14 the learned Additional Sessions Judge had not put any reliance on the acquittal of the accused by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, of the offence under the Arms Act, observing that any expression of opinion contained in the judgment was not only not binding on him but was irrelevant under the Indian Evidence Act.\nOn a perusal of the evidence led by the prosecution in this behalf he had held that the recovery of Ex. P-14 was proved against the accused and considered that as connecting Pritam Singh Lohara with the incident. The High Court, on the other hand, relied upon the observations of Lord MacDermott at p. 479 in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor, Federal of Malaya, 1950 A.C. 458 (A):--\n\"The effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent Court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the adjudication.\nThe maxim 'res judicata pro veritate accipitur' is no less applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict and was precluded from taking any steps to challenge it at the second trial\".\nHaving regard, therefore, to the circumstances attendant upon the recovery of the revolver Ex. P-14 and the acquittal of the accused of the offence under Section 19(f), Arms Act, the High Court was of the opinion that this evidence could not be taken into consideration against him.\nThe High Court, however, held that the evidence against Pritam Singh Lohara consisting of that of the eye-witnesses who stated that they saw him getting into the bus and then committing the murders and running away from the spot, of identification of footprints and of absconding, which was quite satisfactory, was sufficient to convict him and it accordingly came to the conclusion that he also had been rightly convicted.\n16. The High Court accordingly dismissed the appeals of both Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Pritam Singh Lohara, did not see any ground for interfering with the sentence of death passed upon them and confirmed the same.\n17. Both Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Pritam Singh Lohara applied for and obtained special leave to appeal from this Court and hence this appeal.\n18. Shri J.G. Sethi, learned counsel for the appellants, attacked in the first instance, the recoveries of the revolver Ex. P-56 and the rifle Ex. P-14 and submitted that neither of these recoveries could be relied upon as corroborative evidence against the respective accused.\nExhibit P-56 was recovered pursuant to the information given by Pritam Singh Lohara and was alleged to have been dug out of a field in the vicinity of the village Dipsinghwala. This revolver Ex. P-56 was alleged to have been taken from the person of Sardul Singh by Pritam Singh Lohara after Sardul Singh had been shot in the motor lorry.\nThe witnesses to the recovery were Shri Om Prakash, the investigating officer, Bakshish Singh and Shamsher Singh, who along with others, Joginder Singh, Gurcharan Singh and Dara Singh had been examined in the trial of Pritam Singh Lohara for the offence under the Arms Act.\nThough the Magistrate, First Class, Faridkot, convicted him in the first instance, the Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, in appeal, discussed the evidence of various witnesses and, giving him the benefit of doubt, acquitted him, remarking that the surfeit of defence evidence taken in conjunction with all the circumstances set out in the judgment raised strong doubts in his mind as to whether Pritam Singh Lohara was at all taken out of the police lock-up and taken to the alleged place of recovery and that the whole case appeared to have been conceived in a shadowy setting redolent with mystery.\nWhen the prosecution led the evidence in the present case they had cited Joginder Singh, Gurcharan Singh and Dara Singh but all of them were given up for one reason or other and the only persons examined were Shri Om Prakash and the two witnesses of recovery Bakshish Singh and Shamsher Singh. Shri Om Prakash was characterised as an unreliable witness and it was pointed out that the circumstance of his having paid Rs. 40 to the driver of the jeep out of his own money and not charging the same to the Government was suggestive of, the fact that he did not go to the spot where the recovery of Ex. P-56 was alleged to have been made nor did he take Pritam Singh Lohara there.\nReliance was placed on an article appearing in the issue of The Tribune dated 11-5-1953, Ex. D-A, which stated that Chanan Singh Orara's murder had been traced, that the arrest of Dara, a notorious smuggler by the local police had led to the recovery of three pistols hanging on the wall of a village well in Lopoki police station, that one of the pistols had been identified as having been worn by Jathedar Chanan Singh who, along with his nephew Sardul Singh, was shot dead in a bus on 2-5-1953 and that the police had also recovered from Chogawan a rifle which was carried by Sardul Singh.\nIt was urged that if this news item was correct Ex. P-56 could not have been recovered from the field near the village Dipsinghwala as alleged and must have been foisted on Pritam Singh Lohara by the police in order to provide a circumstantial piece of evidence against him.\nThe observations of the High Court, in appeal, were also relied upon to show that this circumstance could not be used against Pritam Singh Lohara having regard to the position in law as set out in the passage from the judgment of Lord MacDermott cited above and if that circumstance was of no avail to the prosecution as against Pritam Singh Lohara, the recovery of the rifle Ex. P-14 was similarly of no consequence there having been a joint trial of both the accused and Ex. P-14 having been one of the pistols alleged to have been recovered from the wall of the village well in Lopoki police station after the arrest of Dara.\nMilka Singh and Sohan Singh who were the two witnesses of the recovery of Ex. P-14 from the person of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri when he was arrested on the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953 were also characterised as the henchmen of the police who were readily available to them for all the searches and raids which they carried out in the locality. Milka Singh had been shown to have taken part in 4 searches and Sohan Singh was shown to have taken part in as many as 7 raids and searches all within one year and were therefore stock witnesses whose evidence could not be relied upon at all.\nThe manner in which the High Court brushed aside the criticisms against these witnesses was, it was urged, very unsatisfactory as the High Court did not take into account the fact that both these witnesses had taken part in raids and searches conducted by the police on numerous occasions and the absence of any pecuniary gratification to these witnesses which the High Court considered sufficient to rehabilitate their evidence could not be a true test of their veracity.\nWe were invited by the learned counsel to take an over-all picture of the circumstances attendant upon both these searches and to come to the conclusion that neither the recovery of Ex. P-56 nor the recovery of Ex. P-14 was satisfactorily established and these pieces of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the prosecution against both the accused were of no value at all.\n19. Whatever be the position in regard to the recovery of Ex. P-56 and the admissibility of evidence in regard to the same as against Pritam Singh Lohara in the present case, the position in regard to the recovery of the rifle Ex. P-14 from the person of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri when he was arrested as aforesaid, stood on a different footing.\nNo reliance could be placed on the article in the issue of The Tribune dated 11-5-1953 and beyond the fact that such an article did appear in that issue, nothing was established to show that 3 pistols including the revolver Ex. P-56 and the rifle Ex. P-14 had been recovered from a wall of the village well in Lopoki police station. The only manner in which the contents of that article could be utilised by the defence was that somebody whose identity was not traced had, in his capacity as the correspondent of The Tribune, published a news-item containing that information and that publication would put the Court on an enquiry into .the circumstances of the alleged recoveries and that the Court would scrutinise with great care the evidence led by the prosecution in regard to-the same.\nThe evidence of Shri Om Prakash certainly could not be viewed with suspicion  merely because the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, had acquitted the accused Pritam Singh Lohara of the charge under the Arms Act and the evidence of the  other witnesses also could not suffer in con  sequence of such acquittal. \nThe evidence of these witnesses, Bakshish Singh and Shamsher Singh in regard to the recovery of Ex. P-56 and of Milka Singh and Sohan Singh in regard to the recovery of Ex. P-14 would have to be considered independently and the latter could be considered against the accused only if the Court was satisfied that it was reliable. The evidence of Milka Singh and Sohan Singh was-scrutinised both by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and also by the High Court and both these Courts came to the conclusion that they could rely upon the same in spite of the criticisms which had been leveled against it by the counsel for the defence.\nThe reasons given by the High Court for rejecting the criticisms against their evidence were no doubt not as satisfactory as they should have been but the fact remains that both these witnesses were believed by the trial Court as also by the High Court and we, exercising our jurisdiction in special leave appeal, are not prepared to differ from that appreciation of the evidence by the Courts below.\nWe are of the opinion that the evidence of Milk a Singh and Sohan Singh establishes the fact of the recovery of Ex. P-14 from the person of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri when he was arrested on the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953 as aforesaid and this recovery of Ex. P-14 affords a cogent piece of circumstantial evidence against Pritam Singh Fatehpuri.\n20. As regards Pritam Singh Lohara, the recovery of Ex. P-56 though supported by the evidence of search witnesses Bakshish Singh and Shamsher Singh amongst others, was not considered enough by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, in appeal, to establish his guilt in regard to the offence under the Arms Act.\nSeveral defence witnesses had been examined by Pritam Singh Lohara in the trial Court including Dara Singh, the notorious smuggler described in the article in The Tribune dated 11-5-1953 above referred to. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, was impressed by that evidence, characterised the evidence of Shri Om Prakash and another police officer as evidence of over-zealous officials and came to the conclusion, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that there was considerable doubt in his mind as regards the guilt of Pritam Singh Lohara and acquitted him.\nThe acquittal of Pritam Singh Lqhara of that charge was tantamount to a finding that the prosecution had failed to establish the possession of the revolver Ex. P-56 by him. The possession of that revolver was a fact in issue which had to be established by the prosecution before he could be convicted of the offence with which he had been charged.\nThat fact was found against the prosecution and having regard to the observations of Lord MacDermott quoted above, could not be proved against Pritam Singh Lohara in any further proceedings between the Crown and him. We are of the opinion that the High Court was right in rejecting the evidence regarding the recovery of Ex. P-56 against Pritam Singh Lohara and the evidence against him would have to be considered regardless of the alleged recovery of Ex. P-56 at his instance.\n21. Learned conusel for the appellants next criticised the identification evidence against both the accused. As regards Pritam Singh Fatehpuri, two identification parades were held, one on 29-5-1953 and the other on 6-6-1953. At the first identification parade, out of 16 Witnesses who were present, the two constables Thakar Singh and Raj Pal were refused by the accused, and, from amongst the rest, only two witnesses, viz., Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh succeeded in identifying him.\nIt was urged that 17 witnesses failed to identify the accused from amongst whom 5 identified Jagir Singh, a wrong person altogether with the result that about 95 per cent of the witnesses failed to identify him. If the margin of error was thus taken into account, the evidence of Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh alone could not be considered sufficient to identify the accused, particularly when Pritam Singh, the driver, who was expected to have observed the accused at the time of the incident, had given an unsatisfactory description in the F.I.R. and had failed to identify him at the identification parade.\nWhile appreciating the strength of this criticism, we cannot, however, ignore the fact that both the Courts below relied upon the evidence of Gurdip Singh as sufficient to establish the identity of the accused and the evidence of Dial Singh also was similarly considered enough for that purpose. These are concurrent findings of fact reached by both the Courts below in regard to the identification of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri by both these witnesses, Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh, and we are of the opinion that he was satisfactorily identified by both of them and that piece of evidence is available to the prosecution against him.\n22. The identification of Pritam Singh Lohara was similary criticised as unsatisfactory. A charge was leveled against Shri Om Prakash that he had shown Pritam Singh Lohara to the identification witnesses in the Deorhi of Faridkot Jail two days before and that most of the witnesses who succeeded in identifying him at the parade closely scrutinized his face and looked about for some mark on his face before they could identify him. More important in this connection was the limp in the gait of Pritam Singh Lohara.\nIt was urged that if Pritam Singh Lohara had that limp and one leg of his was shorter than the other it was curious that none of the witnesses who were present in the lorry at the time of the incident noticed it when he made himself scarce thereafter.\nWe are not impressed by this criticism. The limp was proved before the learned Additional Sessions Judge and in fact he made his own observation in regard to the same commenting that when Pritam Singh Lohara was made to walk in his presence the limp was particularly in evidence though on former occasions it had not been so noticeable.\nThough the limp was certainly there, it was not such as to necessarily attract the notice of the witnesses who were present in the lorry at the time of the incident and it is highly probable that, in the flurry, none of these witnesses noticed that one of the culprits had such a limp. Their attention must have been concentrated more on the events that happened in the lorry and the risk to their own persons rather than on the limp in the gait of one of the culprits who, immediately after the incident, ran away snatching the cycles of four persons whom they came across in the course of their flight.\nThe absence of any mention of this limp, therefore, by these witnesses as also by Pritam Singh, the driver, in the F.I.R. which he made to the police immediately thereafter is not of much consequence. Both the Courts were moreover satisfied as regards the result of the identification parade held in regard to Pritam Singh Lohara and found as a fact that he was identified as one of the culprits. The identification of both Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Pritam Singh Lohara, therefore, stands established and is a piece of circumstantial evidence which can be used against them.\n23. It was further urged that the track evidence was quite unsatisfactory and should not have been relied upon by the Courts below. The science of identification of footprints was in a very rudimentary stage and it was submitted that such evidence could not furnish a satisfactory clue to the identity of the culprits.\nThe shoes which were found in the  search at the house of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri  had not been established to belong to him  and in the absence of any satisfactory evidence as to their ownership, any comparison  of the impressions made by those shoes with  the moulds prepared from the foot-prints on  the spot could not establish the identity of  Pritam Singh Fatehpuri as one of the culprits. \nThere was, moreover, a further circumstance in regard to him which was very vehemently criticised by his learned counsel and it was that in his examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C. the learned Additional Sessions Judge asked him to wear those shoes in order to see whether they fitted him. When he wore the shoes in Court, he complained that they were too tight for him; nevertheless the Court remarked that to all appearances they quite fitted his feet.\nThis observation of the Court, it was urged, was not legitimate and could not be considered against him. It was, therefore, contended that the track evidence was enough to establish the identity of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri as one of the culprits involved in the affair. We are unable to accept this contention. The science of identification of foot-prints is no doubt a rudimentary science and not much reliance can be placed on the result of such identification. The track evidence, however, can be relied upon as a circumstance which, along with other circumstances, would point to the identity of the culprit though by itself it would not be enough to carry conviction in the minds of the Court.\nThe shoes had been recovered in the search of the house of the accused and the result of the search was proved by calling the search witnesses whose evidence Was believed by both the Courts with the result that these shoes, having been recovered from his house, the ownership of the shoes was prima facie established to be his even though the accused had alleged that he was not staying in the house but had rented the house for some acquaintance of his.\nThere was evidence to show that he and his wife were staying there right up to 10 A.M. on 9-6-1953 on which day the search was made and if this evidence was believed it would go to establish his ownership of the shoes. If he was the owner of these shoes it was quite legitimate to compare the impressions made by these shoes with the moulds prepared from the foot-prints on the spot.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, in order to derive further assurance attempted, in the examination of the accused under Section 342. Criminal P. C. to see if these shoes which had been recovered from the house of the accused fitted his feet. If the accused had refused to accede to this suggestion of the learned Additional Sessions Judge he would have been justified in doing so and there is no provision in law by which this demonstration could have been made.\nThe accused, however, agreed to do so and on the shoes being tried on his feet it appeared that they fitted his feet. Realising, however, that the result of this demonstration would be adverse to his defence he complained that the shoes were too tight for his feet.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, thought otherwise and recorded his impression accordingly. This type of evidence was very strongly criticised by the learned counsel for the appellants as real evidence which was not justified at all by the provisions of Section 539B, Criminal P. C. or otherwise and it was urged that it was a matter which prejudiced the defence of the accused.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge was certainly not entitled to allow his view or observation to take the place of evidence because such view or observation of his could not be tested by cross-examination and the accused would certainly not be in a position to furnish any explanation in regard to the same.\nThe whole thing appears to have been done with the consent of the accused and the only criticism which could be legitimately leveled was against the observation recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge that \"to all appearance they quite fitted the feet of the accused even though he complained that the shoes were too tight for his feet\".\nThis observation could not carry the matter any further for the prosecution and the only fact which could be relied, upon by the prosecution was that the shoes apparently fitted the feet of the accused and the learned Additional Sessions Judge and the assessors were entitled only to take into account the fact that the shoes apparently fitted the feet of the accused though he complained that they were too tight for his feet.\nThis was occular demonstration and the result of such occular demonstration could certainly be taken into account by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and the assessors and they were entitled to come to their own conclusions taking into account the further fact that the accused did complain at the time that the shoes were too tight for his feet.\nThe evidence of the trackers and also the fact that shoes were found in the house of the accused and the impressions made thereby tallied with the moulds prepared from the foot-prints on the spot were even otherwise enough to establish the identity of the foot-prints and point to Pritam Singh Fatehpuri as one of the culprits.\n24. The case of Pritam Singh Lohara in regard to the track evidence was no different. In spite of the fact that none of the witnesses of the occurrence nor Pritam Singh, the driver, had stated anywhere before that Pritam Singh Lohara had a limp in his gait, the result of the evidence of the trackers was sufficient to establish that one of the culprits made foot-prints which showed that his way of walking was outwards and he put his right-foot more outwards than the left.\nThis was quite characteristic of Pritam Singh Lohara by reason of the limp in his gait and this was further demonstrated by the impressions which he made when he walked in the District Jail with the shoes given to him there on the sandy patch which was specially prepared for the purpose.\nThis evidence in regard to Pritam Singh Lohara also was believed by both the Courts below as sufficient to establish his identity as one of the culprits and we are not prepared to differ from their appreciation of the evidence. The track evidence, therefore, was a circumstance which was available to the prosecution against Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Pritam Singh Lohara.\n25. The evidence of the police constables Thakar Singh and Raj Pal was very severely criticised by the learned counsel for the appellants. Even though Thakar Singh belonged to the police force and Pritam Singh Fatehpuri once belonged to the same and was known to him before the date of the incident, his name was not given out by Thakar Singh when Pritam Singh, the driver, made the enquiries from the passengers on the spot with the result that in the F.I.R. Pritam Singh the driver, gave such description of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri as he could.\nThe identity of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was established only later on a clue being furnished by Thakar Singh himself to Shri Om Prakash and even then he was able to give out his name in the first instance but the name was ascertained later. Both these police constables did not reveal their identity on the spot nor did they take charge of the investigations but waited until Shri Om Prakash took their statements when only they disclosed to him who they were.\nThese criticisms, though they go some way towards creating a doubt about the veracity of these witnesses, do not, in our opinion, destroy the same.\nBoth these witnesses were, after due consideration of the circumstances and the criticisms leveled against their evidence, believed by both the Courts below and it is not for us to re-weigh or to re-appreciate their evidence and come to a contrary conclusion. Hearing the appeal on special leave, we should not lightly interfere with the appreciation of the evidence by the Courts below and we do mot see anything in the circumstance of this case which would compel us to do so.\n26. The facial identification of both the accused by the learned Additional Sessions Judge on a comparison of the description in the F.I.R. and the accused appearing in the dock before him was also very severely criticised by the learned counsel for the appellants and it was urged that this also was on a par with the real evidence furnished by the demonstration of the fitting of the shoes on the feet of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri while he was being examined under Section 342, Criminal P. C.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, it was said, was not entitled to make such a comparison and come to a conclusion in regard to the identity of the accused as the culprits involved in the affair. We have the same remarks to make in connection with this facial identification as we made in connection with the other incident. There is this difference, however, between the two circumstances.\nWhereas in the case of the fitting of the shoes the assessors were also witnesses to the demonstration and could have been possibly influenced by the fact of the apparent fitting of the shoes to the feet of the accused, in the case of this facial identification it was only personal to the learned Additional Sessions Judge himself who mentioned it only in his judgment while discussing the various circumstances against the accused.\nNonetheless it must be acknowledged that it was not quite legitimate for the learned Additional Sessions Judge to do so because it would be substituting his view and observations in the place of evidence which could be tested by cross-examination and in respect of which it would be open also to the accused to furnish an explanation if such an explanation was asked for in his examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C.\nIn the absence of such test having been applied and an explanation sought from the accused in regard to the same, we are of the opinion that it was not open to the learned Additional Sessions Judge to incorporate these observations of his in the judgment and base his conclusions on the same.\nWe are, however, of the opinion that even discarding these observations of the learned Additional Sessions Judge in regard to the facial identification of both the accused, there is abundant evidence on the record which would justify his conclusions against them.\n27. The absconding of both the accused after the incident and their having made themselves scarce right from 2-5-1953 up to the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953 in the case of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and up to 9-6-1953 in the case of Pritam Singh Lohara is a further circumstance against them.\nNo satisfactory explanation was at all rendered by either of them in regard to their absence from their normal place of residence and, they were not available to the police in spite of all their efforts to trace them. This absconding of the accused, therefore, along with the other incriminating circumstances goes a great way to point to their culpability.\n28. Having devoted our anxious thoughts to all the arguments addressed to us by the learned counsel for the appellants, we have come to the conclusion that the High Court was quite correct in the summary of the evidence against each of them and in holding that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing the guilt of the accused in regard to the offences with which they had been charged.\n29. We, therefore, dismiss the appeal and confirm the conviction and the sentence of death passed upon each of the accused. The sentences will be carried out according to law.\n"}, {"id": "444871", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Eradu And Ors. vs State Of Hyderabad on 1 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

These are Appeals with special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Hyderabad confirming the convictions and the sentences of transportation for life imposed upon the appellants, accused 1 to 4, by  the  Court   of the Additional   Sessions Judge, Medak, in respect of an offence under Section 243, I. P. C. corresponding to Section 302, Indian Penal Code.\n2. The accused 1 to 4, along, with one Baldev Muthiah, were charged that they, on or about the 15th day of Isfandar 1359 F. (15th January 1950) at 10 o'clock in the night, abducted one Muneem Lachiah, Telanga, resident of Dognelli, who was at his house, and carried him outside the village where they did him to death, due to enmity, by hitting him with stick and spear and that they took away a silver kardoda and arm kada from his body and that they thereby committed offences punishable under Sections 243 and 330, I. P. C.\n3. The learned Sessions Judge convicted the accused 1 to 4 of the offence under Section 243, I. P. C. and sentenced them to transportation for life. The accused 2 was further convicted under Section 337, I. P. C. and sentenced to a term of two years rigorous imprisonment. The sentences of transportation for life were submitted to the High Court for confirmation in accordance with the relevant provision of law in Hyderabad.\nThe High Court of Hyderabad, in appeal, agreed with the conclusion reached by the learned Sessions Judge and confirmed the conviction of the accused 1 to 4 under Section 243, I. P. C. and the sentences of transportation for life awarded to them by the Court below.\nOne of the learned Judges of the High Court simply confirmed the sentence tinder Section 243, I. P. C. but another learned Judge held that the accused were guilty of the offences under Sections 243 and 330, Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code (possibly meaning thereby the A. P. C.) and sentenced each of the accused to undergo life imprisonment on the above charges ill-realising that, in the whole of the judgment with which he agreed, there was not a word to justify the conviction under Section 330, A. P. C.\nIn substance, the judgment of the High Court came to this that the accused were convicted of the offence under Section 243, A. P. C. and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment in respect of the same.\n4. There was no direct evidence of the accused having committed the offence. The whole case rested on circumstantial evidence and that evidence consisted of the testimony of three witnesses, the wife of the deceased P. W. 5, the young son of the deceased P. W. 6 and a neighbour P. W. 7, who deposed that, on the evening of the day in question, all the four accused had gone to the house of the deceased and accosted him, asking him to accompany them to the well of one Deshmukh.\nThere was evidence of ill-will between the deceased and the accused in that the accused were alleged to have abducted the deceased a month before the alleged murder and set him at liberty on payment of a ransom of Rs. 350/- and also that the accused had, only three days before, deprived the deceased of a goat belonging to him from, the possession of Kumari Sayiga P. W. 2 and slaughtered it and ate it away and there was consequently a quarrel arising out of the search of the house of accused 1 and 2 made at the instance of the deceased.\nLastly, there were recoveries of the silver kardoda at the instance of accused 2, a white turban and a stick from the house of accused 1 and another stick from the house of accused 3. The silver kardoda was alleged to have been removed from the person of the deceased and buried in a secluded spot which was pointed out by accused 2 and the white turban was alleged to have been stained with human blood.\nThese were the pieces of circumstantial evidence which, according to the learned Sessions Judge, pointed inevitably to the conclusion that accused 1 to 4 were responsible for his death. The learned Judges of the High Court also were of the opinion that there were no eye-witnesses but a strong motive for the murder and the fact of all the accused having abducted the deceased on the night before the dead-body of the deceased was found were proved and these circumstances led to the conclusion that the accused were the perpetrators of the crime.\n5. There is no doubt that the deceased was done to death in a brutal manner and after he was so done to death his dead-body was brought to the doddi or the backyard of his house and was hung there by means of a piece of rope tied round his neck. The theory of suicide was rightly discarded by the Courts below and it was evident on the inquest report as also on the doctor's evidence that the injuries inflicted on the person of the deceased were homicidal injuries. The only question, therefore, which remained to be considered by the Courts below was whether accused 1 to 4 were responsible for those injuries and the consequent death of the deceased.\n6. There is also no doubt that accused 1 to 4 had in fact approached the deceased on the evening of that day and accosted him asking him to accompany them to the well of Deshmukh. This fact was proved by the evidence of the witnesses P. W. 5, P. W. 6 and P. W. 7 all of whom were believed by both the Courts below.\n7. It could not, however, by itself be enough to connect accused 1 to 4 with the crime. There was no evidence at all of any further movements of accused 1 to 4 or one or more of them nor was there anything to connect them with the crime except the recoveries made at their instance as evidenced by the various panchnamas which were proved before the learned Sessions Judge.\nThese panchnamas were criticised by the learned counsel for the appellants as containing evidence which was clearly inadmissible inasmuch as they contained, statements alleged to have been made by accused 1, 2 and 3 in regard to their participation in the crime.\nDiscarding these pieces of inadmissible evidence, therefore, there were indications of accused 1, 2 and 3 having pointed out the several articles which were recovered at their instance, as stated in the respective panchnamas and they proved that the silver kardoda was recovered at the instance of accused 2, a white turban and the stick were recovered at the instance of accused 1 and another stick was recovered at the instance of accused 3.\nThe white turban, even though it was alleged to have been stained with human blood, was, however not sent for analysis to the chemical analyser and the allegation in regard to its having been stained with human blood stood unconfirmed by any such analysis. The sticks also which were recovered at the instance of accused 1 and 3 were not alleged to bear any stains of human blood and there was nothing to distinguish these sticks from any other sticks which might ordinarily be found at the place of such people.\nThe silver kardoda was an article in common use by the people in that locality and there was nothing to identify it with the silver kardoda alleged to have been worn by the deceased except the bare word of his wife P. W. 5. These recoveries, therefore, could not connect accused 1 to 4 with the crime.  The recovery of the silver kardoda could, at best, prove that accused 2 was in the know of the same after it had been removed from the person of the deceased by whosoever was responsible for doing the deceased to death.\nNo charge of murder could certainly be entertained against him by reason of such recovery. The stick and the white turban recovered at the instance of accused 1 could also not connect accused 1 with the crime, the stick being an ordinary stick which was not proved to be the weapon of offence and the white turban not having been sent for chemical analysis of the blood stains alleged to have been found upon the same. The stick recovered at the instance of accused 3 was similarly innocuous and none of these recoveries could be enough to fasten upon accused 1 to 3 responsibility for the crime.\n8. The motive which was alleged against accused 1 to 4 also was equally unhelpful to the prosecution. The previous incident of accused 1 to 4 having abducted the deceased and having set him at liberty on receiving a ransom of Rs. 350 could not show that accused 1 to 4 had any grudge against the deceased. If at all they had received the ransom of Rs. 350, they could not be said to bear any ill-will against the deceased by reason of having received that payment.\nThe later incident of the goat having been slaughtered and eaten away by accused 1 to 4 might have led to some sort of bitterness between the deceased and them but the animosity would be on the side of the deceased and not of the persons who had eaten the goat. The version, however, given by the wife of the deceased, P. W. 5, in regard to this incident having been responsible for the enticing away of the deceased was not such as to carry conviction with the Court.\nIn the inquest report which was made on 16-1-1950, the wife of the deceased had stated that accused 1 to 4 had called her husband to settle the account of the excise contract. In the evidence which she gave before the Sessions Court, she stated that on her enquiry from accused 1 to 4 why they were taking him away they replied that they had eaten the goat and they wanted to repay him for it.\nBoth these statements could not be reconciled with each other and whatever be the correct version it rested merely on the bare word of the witness herself and was not corroborated by either of the two witnesses P. W. 6 or P. W. 7. Under the circumstances, the motive could not be said to have been satisfactorily established by the prosecution and that circumstance was certainly of no avail.\n9. If, therefore, neither the motive nor the recoveries could be of any help to the prosecution, the only thing which remained was the circumstance of accused 1 to 4 having accosted the deceased on the evening of that day and taken him away to the well of Deshmukh without anything more to connect them with the crime.\nThe only offence which could be laid at their door on that fact being established could be one of abduction which would involve the infliction upon them of a punishment which would certainly not be fife imprisonment. As we are informed all the accused have been undergoing sentences of rigorous imprisonment for the last 5 years and more and that would be more than enough to atone for the offence of abduction, if at all they committed the same.\n10. The conviction for the offence under Section 243, A. P. C., however, could not be sustained on the evidence as it stands on the record. It is a fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that circumstantial evidence should point inevitably to the conclusion that it was the accused and the accused only who were the perpetrators of the offence and such evidence should be incompatible with the innocence of the accused.\nBoth the Courts below considered that the fact of accused 1 to 4 enticing away the deceased on that evening and the further fact of the deceased having been found hanging in the doddi or the backyard of his house were by themselves enough to lead inevitably to the conclusion that it was the accused and the accused only who were responsible for the crime.\nWe cannot agree with this conclusion reached by the Courts below. In our opinion, these circumstances, by themselves, are not enough without anything more to connect the accused with the crime and the accused are entitled to be acquitted of the offences with which they have been charged.\n11. In view of the fact that they have already undergone rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and more, we do not think it necessary to order any further investigation into any other offence accused 1 to 4 might be alleged to have committed in connection with the occurrence.\nIn the case of accused 2 also, we do not think it necessary to express any opinion as regards his conviction under Section 337, A. P. C. because he has already undergone rigorous imprisonment for two years which was imposed  upon  him by  the   learned   Sessions Judge in respect of the same.\n12. We accordingly allow the appeals, quash the convictions and the sentences imposed upon the appellants under Section 243,  A. P. C. and order that the appellants be  discharged and set at liberty forthwith.\n"}, {"id": "155267", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Merla Ramanna vs Nallaparaju And Others on 4 November, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nMERLA RAMANNA\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nNALLAPARAJU AND OTHERS.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n04/11/1955\n\nBENCH:\nAIYYAR, T.L.

The appellant instituted a suit in\nthe  court  of the Subordinate Judge of\t Kakinada,  for\t the\nrecovery  of  the amount due on the mortgage,  dated  14-12-\n1911, and prayed for sale of the hypotheca.  The respondents\nwere  impleaded as defendants but did not appear.  The\tsuit\nwas  decreed ex parte, and in execution of the\tdecree,\t the\nproperties of the respondents, mortgaged to A on  19-7-1909,\nwere  brought to sale, and purchased by\t the  decree-holder.\nThe  respondents  then instituted the present  suit  in\t the\nDistrict Court of East Godavari which then bad\tjurisdiction\nover  the  properties in suit, for a  declaration  that\t the\ndecree\t obtained  by  the  appellant  was  fraudulent\t and\ninoperative  and could not affect their title.\t The  plaint\nwas later on amended and a prayer added that the  properties\nmight  be  partitioned and the respondents put\tin  separate\npossession  of their share.  The trial Judge  dismissed\t the\nsuit and the District Court in appeal affirmed his decision.\nBefore the High Court in second appeal it was contended\t for\nthe first time that the decree in question did not direct  a\nsale  of  the mortgaged properties but a sale of  the  mort-\ngagee's\t rights under the mortgage deed dated 19-7-1909\t and\nas such the sale of the properties was void.  The High Court\nhaving\tcalled for a finding from the District Court  as  to\nwhat was sold, it was\n939\nfound  by that Court that the decree bad really\t directed  a\nsale  of  the mortgagee's rights and not of  the  properties\nmortgaged  and that there was excessive execution.  It\twas,\nhowever,  of opinion that the point should have\t been  taken\nbefore\tthe  executing court and the suit in so\t far  as  it\nclaimed\t relief\t on  the basis of  excessive  execution\t was\nbarred under s. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The High\nCourt declined to entertain the objection that the suit\t was\nbarred\tunder s. 47 as it had not been taken in the  written\nstatement  and\twas  raised for the  first  time  in  second\nappeal, and decreed the respondent's suit.  It was contended\nfor   the  appellant  that  the\t High  Court   should\thave\nentertained  the  objection and held that the  suit  was  so\nbarred.\nHeld,  that the appellant should be permitted to  raise\t the\ncontention.   The point relating to excessive execution\t had\nnever been specifically raised except before the High  Court\nand  the allegations in the plaint were vague  and  obscure.\nIt  is\ta  pure question of law which  requires\t no  further\ninvestigation  of  facts and was understood and\t debated  as\nsuch by the parties before the District Court.\nThat  it  was  well settled that  the  question\t whether  an\nexecution  sale was in excess of the decree and,  therefore,\nnot  warranted by it could be raised as between the  parties\nonly  by an application under s. 47 of the Code\t before\t the\nexecuting court and not by a separate suit.\nJ.

This is another appeal which comes before this Court on \"leave\" granted by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad which does not fulfil the requirements of Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution. Only the other day this Court in the case of Baladin Lodhi v. State of Uttar Pradesh,  had occasion to draw the attention of that Court to the observations made in the reported case of Nar Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh .\nIt was observed by this Court that the grant of a certificate under Article 134(1)(c) is not a matter of course but that the power has to be exercised after considering what difficult questions of law or principle were involved in the case which should require the further consideration of this Court. If the case as decided by the High Court oh the face of it did not involve any such questions, then apparently there was no justification for the High Court to certify that the case is a fit one for appeal to this Court.\nIt was further observed that the word \"certifies\" in Sub-article (1) (c) is a strong word which requires the High Court to look closely into the case to see if any special considerations arise. If a case does not involve any question of law, then however difficult the question of fact may be, that would not justify the grant of a certificate under Article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution, because if the High Court has any doubt about the facts of a criminal case, the benefit of that doubt must go to the accused.\nIf, on the other hand, the High Court has no doubt about the guilt of the accused and confirms the order of conviction passed by the trial Court, ordinarily there could be no ground for entertaining an application for a certificate that the case was a fit one for a further appeal to this Court. Where the High Court has reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death or where it has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any Court subordinate to it and has convicted an accused person and sentenced him to death, those cases would be covered by the provisions respectively of Article 134(1)(a) and 134(1)(b) of the Constitution.\nTherefore, ordinarily in a case which does not involve a substantial question of law or principle in an affirming judgment, the High Court would not be justified in granting a certificate under Sub-article (c) of Article 134(1) of the Constitution.\n2. As will presently appear, the present case does not at all involve any question of law, far less any such question of unusual difficulty or importance. The conviction by the Courts below is based entirely on circumstantial evidence.\nThe only question before the High Court was whether the circumstances disclosed in the evidence do or do not unmistakably point to the conclusion that the accused was the guilty person. If the High Court had any doubt about the guilt of the accused or had any difficulty in accepting the evidence, its clear duty was to acquit. If, on the other hand, the High Court found, as it did find in the case in hand, that the evidence pointing to the guilt of the accused was clear, cogent and reliable, it had to dismiss the appeal.\nNo further question of doubt or difficulty could arise thereafter. In our opinion, therefore, the High Court's order which is the last sentence in the judgment appealed from in these terms: \"Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been asked for and is allowed\" was erroneous. In the result, we must hold that the certificate, if it can be called one, granted by \"the High Court does not fulfil the requirements of Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution.\n3. But that conclusion does not necessarily mean the end of the appeal. We have to consider whether in the circumstances of this case this Court could have thought fit to grant special leave in terms of Article 136 (1) of the Constitution. We therefore proceed to examine the case from that point of view.\n4. The facts of this case are simple. The accused Sunder Singh, was one of the several police constables attached to the D.I.G. of Police, Central Range, U.P. He was functioning as his orderly peon and used to drive his car. He along with a number of police constables used to stay in the out-houses with six rooms, attached to the official quarters of the D.I.G. of Police. The appellant, Het' Ram (P.W. 1), Sadhu Ram (P.W. 6), and Ram Lal, constables used to live in some of the rooms of the out-houses.\nThe appellant and Ram Lal apparently were on friendly terms. The appellant used to go to the room occupied by Ram Lal and his wife. The other constables were not living with their families. The prosecution case is that on the night between the 2nd and 3rd February 1954 at about 10 P.M. the appellant and Ram Lal aforesaid together left the bungalow of the D.I.G. on a cycle. Ramlal pedalled on the carrier. They proceeded towards the La Martiniere Ground, which is adjacent to the West of the D.I.G.'s bungalow with pucca roads on the north and west.\nThere is a culvert on the pucca road running east to west on the north of the La Martiniere Ground. The appellant returned alone by about 1 A.M. the same night. The next morning one Jagat Narain, a constable of the Armed Guard, noticed the dead body of a constable lying behind the residence of Shri Hukum Singh, Minister, near the La Martiniere Ground. He informed the D.I.G. of Police. Het Ram (P. W. 1) and other inmates of the servants quarters went and saw the dead body which they identified to be that of Ramlal. It had multiple incised wounds. Het Ram lodged the first information report at 7-40 A.M. on 3-2-1954, at Hazratganj thana in the city of Lucknow.\nSub-Inspector Ishtiaq Ahmad (P. W. 16) arrived at the spot and started investigation. After holding the inquest and sending the dead body for post-mortem examination, he noticed blood marks on the shoes of the appellant who was with him during the investigation. He formally arrested him at about 3 P.M. and interrogated him. He took possession of his shoes in the presence of two rickshaw drivers whom he picked up on the road and prepared-the seizure list (Ex. P-8) of the shoes (Ex. VIII).\nThereafter accompanied by the appellant and the two witnesses aforesaid, he went to search the appellant's room which he found locked. The appellant opened the lock. Inside the room was a box which was also unlocked by the appellant with his key. From inside the box were recovered bloodstained khaki shirt and pants (Exs. IX and X). From there he was taken to the culvert aforesaid on the road on the north of the Ground at a distance of about 200 paces from the quarters.\nFrom underneath the culvert a karauli (Ex. P-XI) (which is a small sword) was recovered as pointed out by the accused. These articles, namely, the bloodstained shoes, shirt, pants and the karauli were sent for examination and the report was that they were stained with human blood. The post-mortem examination was held by the Civil Surgeon of Lucknow, Dr. C.P. Tandon, who found as many as 32 incised and stab wounds, including one small abrasion which may have been caused by a fall.\nThe most serious of those wounds were on the back of the neck and back of the head which were homicidal and caused by \"a sharp-edged sharp pointed weapon\". A number of ribs were cut and so were the pleura, the larynx, the right lung, the pericardium (membrane of the heart), the large vessels on the left side of the neck, aorta and pulmonary artery and oesophagus. The stomach contained about 10 ounces of semi-digested food.\nIn the opinion of the doctor, death was due to \"shock and haemorrhage from the extensive injuries\" which \"could be caused by the weapon Ex. XI shown to me\". In cross-examination the doctor (P. W. 7) stated that \"the wounds on the neck could also be caused by a sword. There was a very remote possibility of stab wound having been caused by a spear\".\n5. As pointed out by the Courts below, the deceased Ramlal was butchered to death in a brutal manner. From the medical evidence it is also clear that the murder took place a few hours after the deceased had taken his night meal some time during the night of 2nd-3rd February, 1954 as alleged by the prosecution and that the karauli (Ex. XI) most likely was the weapon used for causing the multiple stab and incised wounds found on the body of the deceased.\n6. At the trial the prosecution adduced no direct evidence implicating the appellant. The case therefore depended entirely on circumstantial evidence which consisted of the following facts:\n(1) that the deceased and the appellant were last seen going together on a cycle at about 10 P.M. on the night of the 2nd February, 1954 towards the La Martiniere Ground where the dead body was discovered the next morning;\n(2) that at about 1 A.M. on the 3rd February, 1954 the appellant came back alone;\n(3) that the  investigating Sub-Inspector seized the shoes worn by the appellant (Ex. VIII), which were found to be stained with human blood as reported by the Serologist;\n(4) that on the search of the room occupied by the appellant from the box which was unlocked by him were recovered bloodstained khaki shirt and bloodstained pants (Exs. IX & X) which were also reported by the Serologist to be stained with human blood; and\n \n\n(5) the recovery of the karauli as pointed out by the accused from underneath the culvert on the pucca road to the north of the La Martiniere Ground.\n7. All these incriminating circumstances have been brought out in the evidence of P. Ws. 1, 6, 10 and 15, members of the constabulary belonging to the personal staff of the D.I.G. of Police, Central Range, and the investigating Sub-Inspector (P. W. 16).\nThe Courts had therefore no doubt that the evidence consisting as it did of his fellow constables and armed guards who had no sort of enmity against the accused, was reliable. They also found that the accused had a motive for murdering the deceased person inasmuch as according to the evidence there was a liaison between him and the wife of the deceased.\nThe learned Judges of the High Court have also pointed out that the nature of the most serious injuries, namely, those on the back part of the neck were such as could have been caused by a person sitting behind when the cycle was being pedalled by the deceased. After those serious injuries had been caused to the deceased he could easily have been overpowered and done to death by the other multiple injuries actually found on the dead body.\nThe Courts below therefore agreed in convicting the appellant of the murder of the deceased and imposing upon him the extreme penalty of the law in the absence of any extenuating circumstances.\n8. In this Court the learned counsel for the appellant has argued in the first instance that the seizure of the bloodstained shoes by the Sub-Inspector (P. W. 16) was not free from doubt as the witnesses who are said to have witnessed the seizure, Md. Irshad (P. W. 12) and Abdul Habib (P. W. 14) were not \"respectable inhabitants, of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate\" as required by Section 103, Criminal P. C.\nOn the face of it, section 103 would not apply to the seizure of the shoes which were being worn by the accused at the time he was with the investigating police officer. The section applies when a search is to be made of a place. It does not apply to the search of a person. In this case the Sub-Inspector saw, the accused putting on the pair of shoes and he seized them. There is no question of search either of a place or of a person.\nHence it was not necessary strictly in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 of the Code that there should have been two independent search witnesses. But the Sub-Inspector out of abundant caution asked those two rickshaw wallahs to be present as they were the persons most easily available.\nThe Sub-Inspector in spite of his efforts could not get any person from the Minister's quarters to be present at the projected search and most of the occupants of the servants quarters of the D.I.G. of Police were police constables or members of the armed guard. The Sub-Inspector naturally thought that the search witnesses should be persons other than constables or members of the arm ed guard.\n9. In respect of the search of the room occupied by the appellant and the recovery of the bloodstained shirt and bloodstained pants aforesaid it was necessary to have at least two search witnesses as required by section 103. Assuming that the two rickshaw-wallahs who actually witnessed the search as found by the Courts below were not respectable inhabitants of the locality, that circumstance would not invalidate the search.\nIt would only affect the weight of the evidence in support of the search and the recovery. Hence at the highest the irregularity in the search and the recovery in so far as the terms of Section 103 had not been fully complied with would not affect the legality of the proceedings. It only affected the weight of evidence which is a matter for Courts of fact and this Court would not ordinarily go behind the findings of fact concurrently arrived at by the Courts below.\nIt was also contended that the malkhana register and the seizure list were not all written in the same ink, but some portions were in different ink and that therefore they were not above suspicion. But these are again matters for Courts of fact. The Courts below have not omitted to consider those special features of the case and have come to the conclusion that those were not circumstances which affected the veracity of the witnesses examined in support of the prosecution case.\n10. The learned counsel for the appellant also sought to attack the findings of the Courts below on the question of motive by pointing out that on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses themselves it appeared that there was intimate friendship between the deceased and the appellant previous to the date of the occurrence.\nThe Courts below have considered that aspect of the case. It has been pointed out that the accused may have had an eye on the handsome wife of the deceased and that he had already developed a liaison with her. It cannot be said that those circumstances were not sufficient motive for the dastardly crime.\nThat is again a matter for Courts of fact. The learned counsel for the appellant has failed to make out any illegality or serious irregularity in procedure which can be said to have occasioned a failure of justice. No reasons have been adduced for interference with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "957056", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Gurcharan Singh And Anr. vs State Of Punjab on 2 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

This is an appeal by special leave on behalf of two brothers, Gurcharan Singh and Jagir Singh, who have been convicted under Section 302, Penal Code and sentenced to transportation for life by the Second Additional Sessions Judge of Ferozepore. Their convictions and sentences have been upheld by a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court by its judgment dated 30-6-1954.\nThe petitioners had been placed on trial along with two others, named Harnek Singh and Munshi. All these four had Been convicted and sentenced, as stated above, by the learned Sessions Judge; but on appeal, the High Court gave Harnek Singh and Munshi the benefit of the doubt and acquitted them.\n2. The prosecution case, shortly stated, is that on 2-9-1953 the two petitioners along with the other two accused, who were acquitted as aforesaid by the High Court, left their village called Sanghu Dhawan, all armed with 'gandasas' and were seen proceeding towards Muktsar town, about three miles away.\nA short time after, Inder Singh accompanied by his son, Gurnam Singh (P. W. 2) and Mohinder Singh (P.W. 4), who also belong to the same village, left for Muktsar to purchase some chemical manure on a permit by the agriculture department. Inder Singh proceeded ahead and the other two were behind him at a short distance. As soon as Inder Singh reached a certain bridge on the way to Muktsar, about a mile from the village, the four accused, who were lying in ambush in a neighbouring 'bajra' field, came out of the field and attacked him.\nGurcharan Singh, the first appellant, opened the attack with a 'gandasa' blow on his head. He was followed by Jagir Singh, accused, who dealt some 'gandasa' blows on his leg. Inder Singh fell down and all the four accused were said to have attacked him with 'gandasas' causing as many as 27 injuries on his person. Inder Singh's two companions, Gurnam Singh and Mohinder Singh aforesaid, raised an alarm but were helpless spectators, who being unarmed, could not venture to come to his rescue.\nFurther it was stated by the prosecution witnesses aforesaid that while there was life still left in Inder Singh, accused Jagir Singh chopped off their victim's head from the body just above the lower jaw and wrapped the head along with the turban in the 'chaddar' of the deceased.\nRaman Singh and Hari Singh (P. Ws.), who were returning from Muktsar, claimed to have seen the last part of the prosecution case, namely, that the four accused were seen making away with the head wrapped in a piece of cloth. Gurnam Singh (P. W. 2) hastened to the police station and lodged the first information report at 5 P. M. the same afternoon, the place of occurrence being noted as a mile and a half towards the east of the police station.\nThe time of the occurrence is not specified except saying that it was in the afternoon. In the first information report all the four accused persons were named and said to have conspired to kill Inder Singh.   The prosecution version as laid in the first information report is substantially as stated above. As regards the motive of the crime, it is said in the first information report \"All the four culprits suspected my father of his having given a secret information against them\".\n3. At the trial Gurnam Singh (P. W. 2) and Mohinder Singh (P. W. 4) deposed as eye-witnesses to the occurrence from beginning to end, whereas Raman Singh (P.W. 6) and Hari Singh (P. W. 7) deposed to the last part of the prosecution case as having witnessed the occurrence on hearing an alarm from about 100 to 150 yards. They claim to have seen all the four accused armed with 'gandasas' and Jagir Singh wrapping the head in a piece of cloth.\n4. The defence of the appellants was a denial of their participation in the occurrence and they explained their implication by alleging that they were on inimical terms with the family of the deceased Inder Singh. The appellant, Jagir Singh, set up a case of 'alibi' which may best be stated in his own words in his statement under Section 342, Criminal P. C. before the Magistrate who held the inquiry. He said:\n\"I am a member of Sanghu Dhawan panchayat. I along with other members of our panchayat came to Muktsar that day at 8 a.m. Chief Minister was here that day. I left Muktsar that day after the oath taking ceremony etc., at about 2-30 p.m. When I reached the local cinema it started raining.\nHead Constable Gurbux Singh and Sadhu Singh of Chak Bir Sarkar met me there. I remained there for about 1-1/2 hours and then went to village, when rain stopped. I was accompanied by Nar Singh, member village panchayat; Gitan Singh, Jalaur Singh & Jit Singh were coming to the thana to make the report. Nar Singh, member Panchayat enquired what the matter was. They replied that their father had been killed by an unknown person. Shortly afterwards, S. Bhag Singh, M.L.A. of Bir Sarkar met us. Then we went to the village. I am innocent\".\n5. It is convenient here to dispose of this particular defence of the accused to which our attention was invited by the learned counsel for the appellants. He urged that this was a very bold defence. It was taken at an early stage of the inquiry against the appellants and it could easily have been verified with reference to the official records.\nIt has been admitted in the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution that there was a function in the forenoon of the date of the occurrence at which the Chief Minister was present and the members of the Panchayat took their oath of office. According to the evidence, this function came to an end at about 12-30 p.m. The burden of proving the 'alibi' undoubtedly lay on the appellant Jagir Singh. It is true, as urged by his counsel, that this was a bold defence, but the burden to establish that defence, however bold it may have been, lay on the accused.\nNo attempt was made to call any evidence, oral or documentary, to prove that the appellant Jagir Singh was present at the ceremony and that it came to an end at about 2-30 p.m. as alleged by him. If that defence had been made out, certainly the appellant Jagir Singh would have been entitled to an acquittal because the occurrence could not have taken place much later than 2-30 p.m., though the exact time of the occurrence is not known.\nBut the indication in the evidence is that it took place at about 3 p.m. As the burden of proving this special defence of alibi has not been discharged, appellant Jagir Singh's case stands on the same footing as that of the other appellant.\n6. But even so, the burden of proving the case against the appellants was on the prosecution irrespective of whether or not the accused have made out a plausible defence. The case for the prosecution against the appellants rests on the testimony, as already indicated, of P. Ws. 2 and 4 who had accompanied the deceased from the village on the journey to Muktsar and P. Ws. 6 and 7 who were on their way back from Muktsar and were attracted to the scene of the occurrence by the alarm raised by those two witnesses.\nThe courts below have discussed the evidence of these four witnesses in great detail and have found it reliable notwithstanding the fact that Gurnam Singh (P. W. 2), Raman Singh (P. W. 6) and Hari Singh (P. W.7) are close relations of the deceased. On the face of it, therefore, there is no question of law involved and no grounds for interference have been made out in special appeal.\n7. But it has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants with his usual vehemence that the High Court did not act upon the testimony of those four witnesses in so far as it acquitted two of four accused, namely, Harnek Singh and Munshi. The reasons for the acquittal of those two persons may be stated in the words of the High Court as follows:--\n\"In regard to the complicity of Harnek Singh and Munshi, I have some doubt and I think that they must be given the benefit of the doubt. Neither Harnek Singh nor Munshi had any motive to murder Inder Singh. In the first information report definite part was assigned to Harnek Singh and Munshi inasmuch as it was said that Harnek Singh and Munshi inflicted gandasa blows from right side while Inder Singh was lying down and cut off major portion of his head from the body.\nGurnam Singh who made the first information report stated at the trial that it was not correct that Harnek Singh and Munshi accused had cut off the head of his father. Mohinder Singh, P. W. 4, gave evidence that Jagir Singh chopped off the head of Inder Singh.\nNo particular injuries are ascribed to Harnek Singh and Munshi. Raman Singh, P. W. 6, and Hari Singh, P. W. 7, deposed that they saw the four accused from a distance of 60 or 70 karams standing near the dead body of Inder Singh and that they had gandasas with them. Raman Singh stated that the four accused walked away towards Ude Karan. In my opinion, the evidence given by Raman Singh, P. W. 6, and Hari Singh, P. W. 7, does, not necessarily connect Harnek Singh and Munshi with the crime\".\n8. In this connection reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants on the recent decision of this Court dated 13-9-1955 (unreported) in the case of Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab (Since ). In that case two persons were placed on trial on a charge of murder and convicted by the trial court.\nOn appeal, the High Court acquitted one of them giving him the benefit of the doubt but maintained the conviction of the other, as also the sentence of death passed upon him. This Court found that the positive evidence against the convicted person was not stronger than or any different from the evidence led against the acquitted person. But that was not the sole ground of the decision.\nThis Court further observed that the direct testimony against the accused persons was not free from blemish, in so far as it appeared from the evidence that the first person who originated the theory of the complicity of the accused in that case was almost a blind: person who could not see things, particularly at the dead of the night, and that the other witnesses who turned up at the alarm had readily accepted the opinion of the first witness that it was the condemned person who had been responsible for the murderous assault.\nThis Court therefore felt a reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the oral testimony and had consequently to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused.\n9. The case in hand is similar to the case reported as Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab  in so far as it was found in that case, as we are inclined to hold in this case, that the acquittal of the other two accused by the High Court may not have been entirely correct.\nReference to that reported case is only by way of illustration and not by way of an appeal to precedent, because on the facts no two cases can be similar. Each case has its own peculiar facts and it is therefore always risky to appeal to precedents on questions of fact. The highest that can be or has Been said on behalf of the appellants in this case is that two of the four accused have been acquitted, though the evidence against them, so far as the direct testimony went, was the same as against the appellants also; but it does not follow as a necessary corollary that because the other two accused have been acquitted by the High Court the appellants also must be similarly acquitted.\nIn the present case the High Court differentiated the case of the two appellants from that of the other two accused whom it acquitted chiefly on the ground that whereas there was some evidence of motive against the two appellants, there was no such evidence against those two acquitted persons. On the question of motive the trial court held that it had not been established that the, deceased Inder Singh had given information to the police leading to the recovery of a pistol from Gurcharan Singh, the first appellant, and his conviction for an offence under the Arms Act.\nIt had only been established that Mohan Singh (P. W. 8), brother of the deceased Inder Singh, had given evidence against the accused in the Arms Act case. If that was the only case of animosity between the two families, the appellants could have greater reasons to be offended against Mohan Singh himself. But it has repeatedly been pointed out by this Court that where the positive evidence against the accused is clear, cogent and reliable, the question of motive is of no importance. As regards the question who gave which blows to the deceased, the prosecution evidence was that after Inder Singh fell from the blows of the two appellants, all the four accused gave gandasa blows to the fallen man.\nBe that as it may, we are no more concerned with the case against those two accused persons who have been acquitted by the High Court; but so far as the appellants are concerned, the evidence of the four eyewitnesses referred to above is consistent and has not been shaken in cross-examination. That evidence has been relied upon by the courts below and we do not see any sufficient reasons to go behind that finding. It is true that three out of those four witnesses are closely related to the deceased Inder Singh.\nBut that, it has again been repeatedly held, is no ground for not acting upon that testimony if it is otherwise reliable in the sense that the witnesses were competent witnesses who could be expected to be near about the place of occurrence and could have seen what happened that afternoon. We need not notice the other arguments sought to be advanced in this Court bearing upon the probabilities of the case because those are all questions of fact which have been adverted to and discussed by the courts below.\n10. In  our  opinion,  no grounds have been made out for interference.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "1178328", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Surjan And Ors. vs State Of Rajasthan on 1 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Rajasthan, whereby a number of accused who were acquitted by the Sessions Judge at the trial were convicted and sentenced on appeal by the High Court.\nIn addition, the High Court while confirming the conviction of another accused (Surjan) under Section 323, Penal Code convicted him also under Section 304, Penal Code and sentenced him therefore to ten years' rigorous imprisonment.\n2. The case arose out of an incident in the village of Dadoosan at or about 10 A.M. on 15-3-1949, between two rival groups. The village was a Jagir village belonging to a Jagirdar by name Thakore Bakhat Singh. The cultivating class in the village were mostly Bisnois and appear to have been split into two groups in connection with certain demands of the Jagirdar against the tenants, viz., the payment of hasal of Guar.\nTwenty families of Bisnois in the village were in favour of the payment to the Jagirdar and seven families against it. The accused are partly members of these seven families and partly residents of adjoining villages. The prosecution witnesses belong mostly to the group of the twenty families favourable to the Jagirdar.\n3. 15-3-1949 was the day next to the Holi called the Dulehandi day. On this day it was usual for the Bisnois to observe a ceremony called Pal at which all the Bisnois collect and take charanamrut from a Sad (who performs the Puja). In view of the existence of groups in the Bisnois of the village, the two groups had their Pal ceremony on that day separately.\nThe trouble arose with reference to the participation in this Pal ceremony of a person called Dhonkala examined as P.W. 4. He participated in the Pal ceremony celebrated by the twenty group. He appears to be somewhat closely related to some members of the seven group, who probably wanted to get him back to their group.\nIt is in the evidence of one of the prosecution witnesses, P.W. 18, that \"Peka (one of the accused belonging to the seven group) the brother of Dhonkala (P.W. 4) directed Dhonkala to join him and leave the twenty\". P.W. 4 himself says that he took Pal with the men of the twenty group and that when after taking Pal he started for home, Lachha (one of the accused belonging to the seven group) told him to take Pal with him and his party and that he did not go to them.\nWhether it was Peka or Lachha, it is clear that one of the members of the seven group wanted P.W. 4 to participate with them and that on his refusal some wordy abuse followed. According to the prosecution case this resulted in some of the accused pursuing P.W. 4 with a view to beat him. P.W. 4 ran into his dhani (hut).\nTwo of the accused Ramchand and Peka thereupon set fire to the dhani with a match stick. The flames which resulted from the fire attracted the attention of the others in the village and the prosecution eye-witnesses came running up to the scene. Some out of them attempted to extinguish the fire but the accused prevented them from doing so.\nOne Abhey Singh, a distant relation of the Jagirdar, was one of the prominent persons who so intervened. His interference was resented and three out of these accused were said to have hit him on the head with lathis which they had in their hands. It may be mentioned that it is part of the prosecution case that all the accused except one Ramchand came to the Pal with lathis in their hands and that accused Ramchand had an axe in his hands.\nThe assault on Abhey Singh by three of the accused resulted in a marpeet in which a number of persons on the prosecution side, viz. Rama, P.W. 13, Sawai, P.W. 14, Ridmal, P.W. 15, Chaina, P.W. 16 and Pusia, P.W. 18, also received injuries. The accused thereupon dispersed and went away to their places. Devi Singh, P.W. 8, the son of the Jagirdar, who is alleged to have run up to the scene of occurrence on noticing the smoke rising from the dhani of Dhonkala and who figured as an eye-witness of the incident in the case, took the injured persons to the Sanchore dispensary.\nAbhey Singh's injuries proved fatal and he died on the way to the hospital. A postmortem examination was held by the Doctor, P.W. 10. He also examined the injuries received by the others. P.W. 14, Sawai, received a large number of injuries numbering as many as thirteen. P.W. 13, Rama, received one injury. P.W. 15, Ridmal, received three injuries, P.W. 16, Chaina, received three injuries. P.W. 18, Pusia, received two injuries.\nAll the injuries of these five persons were simple consisting of contusions, abrasions, swellings and so forth, excepting one injury on Sawai, P.W. 14, which was a \"simple fracture at the junction of the upper one-fourth with the lower three-fourth of the left radius\". All the injuries, according to the Doctor, were received by blunt weapons excepting one incised wound on Pusia, P.W. 18, which according to the Doctor, was inflicted with a sharp weapon.\nIn the prosecution evidence this injury was ascribed to the accused Ramchand, who is said to have had an axe in his hand. The first information of this incident was lodged with the Circle Inspector of Police, Sanchore, on 15-3-1949, by Devi Singh, P.W. 8. Challan was presented against seventeen persons who, after preliminary enquiry, were committed to the Court of Session by the First Class Magistrate, Bhinmal, by his order dated 24-12-1949. The accused were charged thereby as follows.\nAll the accused were charged under Section 148, Penal Code, the common object of the assembly being said to be to set the dhani of Dhonkala on fire. Accused Surjan was separately charged under Section 302, Penal Code for causing the death of Abhey Singh. Accused Ramchand and Peka were charged under Section 436, Penal Code for setting fire to the dhani of Dhonkala, P.W. 4, Accused Ramchand was also separately charged under Section 324, Penal Code in view of his alleged assault with an axe in his hand.\nIn addition to these, all the accused were charged under Section 302, Penal Code taken with 149, Penal Code, Section 325, Penal Code taken with 149, Penal Code & Section 436, Penal Code taken with 149, Penal Code. At the Sessions trial, in addition to the above charges, individual charges were added against eight of the accused under Section 323, Penal Code.\nAfter trial, the learned Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that no unlawful assembly with a common object as alleged was made out. He was not satisfied that Ramchand and Peka set fire to the dhani of Dhonkala or that Surjan dealt the fatal blow on Abhey Singh.\nAccordingly he acquitted Ramchand, Peka and Surjan in respect of the respective individual charges framed against them. In view of his finding that unlawful assembly was not made out, he acquitted all the accused of the various charges against them under Sections 302/149, 325/149 and 436/149, Penal Code. The view taken by him was that the several accused could be found guilty only in respect of the individual part played by each.\nDealing with the evidence on this footing, he did not feel satisfied about the evidence against any of the accused excepting four. They were Surjan, Bhagchand son of Hamira, and Dhonkala (a person different from Dhonkala P.W. 4), who were said to have been the assailants of the deceased Abhey Singh, and Kana son of Hanuta who is said to have assaulted Sawai, P.W. 14. He accordingly convicted Surjan, Bhagchand and Dhonkala under Section 323, Penal Code and Kana under Section 325; Penal Code and sentenced each of them to undergo one year's rigorous imprisonment.\nThe remaining were acquitted. Thus thirteen persons were acquitted in toto while the four above mentioned were acquitted of all the major charges and were convicted only in respect of minor charges (Sections 823 and 325, Penal Code).\n4. Against this judgment the State filed an appeal disputing the correctness of the acquittals excepting as regards Rama. The four convicted persons also filed an appeal as regards the convictions and sentences against them.\nThe High Court dealt with these two appeals together. It was of the opinion that the judgment of the Sessions Judge was \"a very weak judgment\". Accordingly it considered the entire evidence for itself and confirmed two of the findings of the learned Sessions Judge, viz., (1) that no unlawful assembly was made out, and (2) that there was no adequate proof as to who set fire to the dhani of P.W. 4. But it was of the opinion that a case under Section 304, Penal Code was satisfactorily made out against accused Surjan in respect of the death of Abhey Singh.\nOn these findings the acquittal of the accused Ramchand and Peka in respect of Section 436, Penal Code, as also of Surjan in respect of Section 302, Penal Code as also the acquittal of all the accused with reference to the charges under Section 149, Penal Code were maintained. The High Court also proceeded on the view that the various accused could be held guilty, only in respect of the individual part played by them at the incident.\nAs regards accused Surjan it came to the conclusion that it was he who dealt the fatal blow on the head of Abhey Singh. He was accordingly held guilty under Section 304 Penal Code. As regards the various other accused it did not agree with the learned Sessions Judge that the individual participation was satisfactorily made out only as against three others, i.e., Bhagchand, Dhonkala and Kana. It held that the evidence of the individual part played by each of the accused was satisfactory in respect of a number of other accused also.\nIn the result the High Court affirmed the total acquittal in respect only of Ramchand and Peka but convicted the fourteen others. Surjan's conviction was altered to that under Section 304, Penal Code, with a sentence therefore of ten years' rigorous imprisonment. The convictions of the other thirteen were in respect of Section 323, Penal Code with a sentence therefore of one year R.I.\nThe appeal to this Court accordingly is by 14 of the original 17 accused, Ramchand and Peka going out by virtue of their total acquittal, and Rama having been left out by the State when filing its appeal to the High Court, for reasons which do not appear on the record. Out of the fourteen appellants who filed this appeal, the name of one person, Lachha, son of Arjun (who appears to have died during the pendency of the appeal in this Court) was struck off from the appeal by order of this Court, dated 13-12-1954.\n5. The main contention of the learned counsel for the appellant before us is that in reversing the acquittal, the learned Judges of the High Court have departed from the standards laid down by this Court in the cases in -- 'Surajpal Singh v. The State', , 'Ajmer Singh v. State of Punjab', , 'Puran v. State of Punjab', I, , 'Ittiravi Nambudiri v. State of Travancore-Cochin,' , 'Prandas v. State', , and 'Bansidhar Mohanty v. State of Orissa', .\nAll these cases lay down that while in such cases the High Court is free to appreciate the evidence for itself and to act on its own view thereof when it differs from that of the trial Court, it will not do so lightly and will be slow to reverse an acquittal except for strong and compelling reasons. These principles are now well-settled and are no longer in dispute.\nIn order to satisfy ourselves about the correctness or otherwise of the contention that the judgment of the High Court is not in consonance with the above standards, we have heard the matter at some length and given our careful consideration to it. We are satisfied that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge and the acquittals consequent thereon were such as called for interference on appeal by the State.\nThe learned Sessions Judge having come to the conclusion that no unlawful assembly was made out, proceeded to consider the question of the criminal liability of the individual accused with reference to the part played by each of them. But in considering the evidence for this purpose he set about this task in a somewhat curious way.\nOne should have thought that he would have taken up the cases of the individual accused one by one and seen who all speak against him and what part each witness ascribes to him, and that he would then have considered whether and how far the evidence of each of such eye-witnesses is reliable as against the particular accused. He has done nothing of the kind. He has set out in a very cursory way the evidence of only such of the prosecution eye-witnesses who have received injuries, i.e., P.Ws. 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18 and has proceeded on a somewhat artificial view that it is by the evidence only of these five witnesses in so far as each was able to speak to and identify his own assailants, that the individual accused could be found guilty.\nThe evidence of a number of other witnesses, which purports to show that the injuries which were in fact received by these prosecution witnesses were also inflicted by a large number of others has been completely ignored or brushed aside, Thus for instance Sawai, P.W. 14, as already stated, received 13 injuries. He himself spoke only to accused Kana, son of Hanuta having aimed a blow with a lathi on his left fore-arm breaking the arm-bone.\nOther witnesses have spoken to Sawai being assaulted by other accused.. Dhonkala, P.W. 4 speaks of Hanuta, Hema, P.W. 6 of Phagloo, Devi Singh, P.W. 8 of Lachha, Hanuta, also as being assailants of Sawai. But the evidence of none of these witnesses with reference to the alleged assaults on Sawai was even referred to, apparently on the unsound and unreal assumption that it is only the victim that can speak about his own assailants.\nBut curiously enough the learned Sessions Judge does not even adhere to his own standard. He reverses the assumption when he dealt with the injuries of Ridmal, P.W. 15. Ridmal received lacerated wounds on the right and left parietal regions. He spoke to Phagloo and Surjan as his assailants. But the learned Sessions Judge does not convict them in respect of the said injuries on the ground that no other eye-witness named them . as the assailants of Ridmal.\nAgain the learned Sessions Judge in considering the evidence of Chaina, P.W. 16, (who received a contusion on the left parietal region and had a swelling with abrasion on the right forearm and another swelling on the left forearm) said that Chaina deposed that Baga had hit him, but that he confused himself about the other assailants by stating first that it was Ramchand, and then correcting himself that it was Lakha. He, therefore, came to the conclusion that it is difficult to say who was the assailant and did not convict even Baga about whom there was no confusion.\nThus it is seen that in acquitting the various accused other than the four convicted by him, the learned Sessions Judge adopted inconsistent and unsound standards without any real effort to assess the credibility of the evidence given by the various alleged eye-witnesses as against each of the accused.\n6. Learned counel for the appellant attempted to justify the acquittals on the ground that the incident was in the nature of a confused melee between two hostile\ngroups in which fairly large numbers participated as alleged in the F.I.R. and that it was not really possible for any individual witness to have noticed who was the assailant of each of the prosecution witnesses that received injuries.\nIn support of his argument, he relied on the evidence that both the groups had  met at the place for the normal and legitimate purpose of performing Pal and that therefore the case that all the accused went there with lathis in their hands must be false.\nIt is pointed out that the incident occurred after the prosecution group had finished taking the Pal and before the accused proceeded to take it and that the F.I.R. which was filed by one of the alleged eye-witnesses, P.W. 8, is absolutely silent as to the part played by each of the accused as against each of the injured persons, but rolled up the whole incident into a vague statement as follows :\n \"40 or 45 persons in all (including the 17 accused whose names were specified) attacked the dhani of Dhonkala son of Hamira and set fire to it and beat Abhey Singh, Sawai, Ridmal, Chaina, Rama, Pusia, from among those who went to extinguish the fire with lathies\".\nIt is suggested that this is all the more remarkable since according to his own evidence, P.W. 8, the first informant, was accompanied by a number of eye-witnesses when he went to file the F.I.R. and that therefore he was in a position to get the complete picture by then.\nIt is also pointed out that most of the eye-witnesses belong to the rival group of Bisnois and were the tenants of the Jagirdar, whose relation Abhey Singh, was the victim of the murder and that individual ill-will of some of the eye-witnesses against some of the accused has also been brought out in cross-examination. It is necessary, however, to notice that the acquittals by the Sessions Judge of the various accused were not based on any such ground.\nIn a case of this kind there may well be adequate answers for criticisms of the sort which the learned counsel for the appellant has put forward. The mere fact that the judgments do not deal with them is not sufficient to show that they were not considered.\nNeither the trial Court nor the appellate Court proceeded on the view that there\nwas a confused melee in which none of the assailants could be identified by any of the witnesses. Nor are the acquittals by the trial Court based on the view that all or any of the eye-witnesses were not present on the scene or had particular motives to implicate any of such accused falsely. Indeed the very defence of six of the accused, viz. Peka Panna, Dhonkala, Ramchand, Kachhaba, and Baga, admits the presence of seven of the prosecution witnesses at the incident, viz., of P.Ws. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 18, and imputes to them aggressive action against themselves which is admitted to be the subject-matter of a counter-case.\nThe defence of alibi set up by some of the accused was not accepted by the trial Court in respect of any one of them. In these circumstances and in view of the highly unsatisfactory appreciation of the oral evidence by the learned Sessions Judge as pointed above, it is not possible to say that there is no justification for the correctness of the various acquittals being closely scrutinised and examined by the appellate Court.\nIn such a situation the Court is not only entitled but bound to give effect to its own independent conclusion on the evidence, giving due weight to all the circumstances which have normally to be kept in view in cases of this kind. We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that there was ample justification for interference by the High Court with the acquittals which resulted from the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge.\n7. Learned counsel for the appellants next submitted that assuming that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge was not satisfactory, the judgment of the High Court reversing the acquittals was not what it should have been. He urged that the learned Judges have not judicially applied their mind to the appreciation of evidence but that all that was done was\" to look at and set out only the evidence in the examination-in-chief of each of the prosecution witnesses without noticing and taking into consideration the material brought out in cross-examination to discredit such evidence.\nIt is also pointed out that the individual guilt of each of the accused was determined by merely cataloguing how many eye-witnesses spoke against each of the accused. On a careful perusal of the judgment of the High Court we cannot help feeling that there is room for the above criticism. This is not, however, to say that the learned Judges did not in fact scrutinise and appreciate the evidence.\nBut they owed it to themselves, when reversing acquittals that their judgment should clearly set out and discuss the evidence of the eye-witnesses as against each of the accused succinctly and categorically, instead of merely cataloguing a summary of the evidence of each prosecution witness and an enumeration of all who spoke against each accused.\n8. On the other hand, the learned Advocate-General for Rajasthan appearing for the State put forward a strenuous argument that the finding of both the Courts that there was no unlawful assembly is erroneous. It is no doubt rather extraordinary that in a case of this kind which was admittedly the outcome of conflict between two hostile groups resulting in the death of one person and injuries on a number of others, the accused should be able to get away with a concurrent finding of both the Courts that there was no unlawful assembly.\nWe have accordingly heard his argument in this behalf and are not prepared to say that the argument is without force. But we cannot give effect to any such argument in view of the fact that both the Courts have concurrently acquitted all the accused in respect of the charge under Section 148, Penal Code and of the various charges under Section 149, Penal Code.\nThe State has not obtained any leave from this Court for appeal against these acquittals. The said acquittals must accordingly stand. The learned Advocate-General urged that he was challenging the finding as to the non-existence of an unlawful assembly not for the purpose of getting the acquittals under Sections 148 and 149, Penal Code set aside and not even for the purpose of asking for any higher sentences in respect of the various convictions as found by the High Court but only in order to maintain those convictions and sentences.\nEven so, we cannot accept the validity of such an argument in justification of maintaining the convictions and sentences. The validity and correctness of the convictions must depend on the other merits of the case. The accused are entitled to the benefit of the finding that there was no unlawful assembly under Section 148, Penal Code and no constructive, liability under Section 149, Penal Code.\n9. What remains, therefore, to be considered is whether there is sufficient evidence as against each of the accused who have been convicted for specific offences in respect of their individual acts. Now, apart from two specific matters which will be dealt with presently, the question as to the sufficiency of evidence is one ultimately for the first appellate Court.\nIt is true that in so far as the appellants other than the four accused convicted by the trial Court are concerned, it cannot be said that there are concurrent findings against them by both the Courts below. Therefore it is arguable that the normal rule which this Court adopts for its own guidance in dealing with appeals by special leave, viz., that of not allowing the evidence to be canvassed, to challenge the concurrent findings of fact, is not applicable to this case.\nAll the same this Court will not, save in very exceptional cases, convert itself into a regular Court of appeal on evidence, in dealing with matters arising by way of special leave. In a case where it finds that the appellate Court has not at all applied its judicial mind to the appreciation of the evidence and grave injustice has resulted therefrom this Court may remand the case to the first appellate Court for fresh consideration. Keeping this in view we have permitted the evidence to be canvassed before us in its broad outline without going into meticulous details.\nOn a careful consideration thereof we are satisfied that this is not a case in which we should either go into a detailed examination of the evidence ourselves or call upon the High Court to reassess the evidence. We are, therefore, not prepared to set aside any of the convictions on the ground of absence of reliable evidence against the individual appellants who have been convicted with reference to the part played by each of them. Only two further questions that have been raised before us remain.\n10. Out of 14 appellants before us there are individual charges only as against nine of them, eight under Section 323, Penal Code arid one against Surjan under Section 302, Penal Code. It is urged that the conviction of the other five against whom the only charges were under Section 149, Penal Code cannot be maintained in the absence of specific charges under Section 323, Penal Code.\nIn view, however, of Section 535, Criminal P. C. prejudice arising from the omission must be made out before the Court can interfere with the convictions. We do not find that there has been any such prejudice or grave injustice in respect of the cases relating to these five accused. We are, therefore, not prepared to interfere in their favour on this ground.\n11. Now so far as accused Surjan is concerned, the case stands on a different\" footing. The specific charge against him is under Section 302, Penal Code for having committed the murder of Abhey Singh. The evidence of all the eye-witnesses was that the three persons Surjan, Bhagchand and Dhonkala son of Samaratha inflicted injuries on the deceased.\nWhile all the eye-witnesses excepting Dhonkala, P. W. 4, ascribe the fatal head-injury to Surjan, P. W. 4, Dhonkala, ascribes it to Bhagchand. The learned trial Judge was therefore not prepared to accept the evidence in so far as it ascribed the specific and fatal blow to Surjan. He was of the view that the evidence did not enable him to say who dealt the fatal blow.\nHaving acquitted all the accused under, Section 149, Penal Code he was of the opinion that each of the three persons including Surjan could be convicted only under Section 323, Penal Code. On-appeal, however, the learned Judges of the High Court virtually ignored the evidence of P. W. 4. In view of the evidence, in this behalf, of all the other eyewitnesses, they were of the opinion that Surjan was the person who gave the fatal blow.\nBut they held that he was guilty not under Section 302, Penal Code but only under Section 304, Penal Code. Surjan was accordingly convicted under Section 304, Penal Code and sentenced to ten years' rigorous imprisonment. Now, it is brought to our notice that it is in the medical evidence that there was more than one blow on the head of the deceased. If so, it is urged that it may well be that the evidence of P. W. 4 is not inconsistent with that of the other witnesses, in so far as they relate to the assault on the head of the deceased.\nIt is submitted that both Bhagchand as well as Surjan may have assaulted the deceased Abhey Singh on the head and that the two assaults may have resulted in two injuries on the head. If this view is accepted it follows that it would be difficult to depend on the evidence to determine who gave the fatal blow. The medical evidence in this behalf has therefore to be considered. P. W. 10 who conducted the post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased Abhey Singh recorded the following injuries on the deceased in his report.\n\"The following anti-mortem injuries were noted:\n1. Lacerated wound 21/2\" x 1/2\" x bone deep on Lt. parietal region.\n2. Contusion 7\" x 3\" front of the Rt. arm.\n3. Contused wound 1/2\" x 1/4\" medical aspect of 1st. phalanx of Rt. middle finger.\n4. Contusion 13\" x 3\" Rt. half of the back.\n5. Contusion 6\" x 2\" on the Rt. shoulder and arm.\n6. Bleeding from nostrils at Lt. ear.\n7. Depression 6\" x 2\" on the Rt. and Lt. parietal region.\nHead: Depressed fracture 8\" x 1\" Rt. and Lt. parietal bones. Deposition of blood clots below the meninges and in the brain substance.   Brain substance decomposed.\n* * * * *\n \n\nCause of death-- Coma due to the compression of the brain as a result of the injury to the head.\"\nIn his evidence before the Court he adds an item by way of No. 8 to the injuries above indicated as follows :\n \"8. Depressed fracture 8\" x 1\" of right and left parietal bones. Deposition of blood dots' below the meninges and in the brain substance.\" \nBut this is merely the note in the post-mortem report given with a separate number. He says that this injury No. 8 was sufficient in the ordinary course to cause death. It is clear that injuries 7 and 8 are the same, injury 7 being the external aspect and injury 3 being the internal aspect.\nThe point to be noticed, however, is that the evidence indicates prima facie two injuries on the head. (1) Lacerated wound on left parietal region, and (2) depressed fracture of right and left parietal bones. This naturally gave rise to some doubt as to whether these two injuries could be caused by one blow or were the result of two blows. The Doctor, P. W. 10, was therefore asked about this in cross-examination. His answer was as follows :\n \"The injury on the head of the deceased could be by one blow and also by more than one blow.\" \nIn view of this dubious answer the Court put questions to him. His answer thereto was the  following:\n\"The two injuries on the head should be by two blows. They could not be caused by single blow. I have wrongly deposed above that they could also be by one blow.' If this evidence of the Doctor is to be accepted -- and there is no reason why it should not be -- it is clear that two blows must have been inflicted on head of the deceased Abhey Singh. The learned Judges of the High Court, however, have not specifically noticed these answers of the Doctor to the questions by Court. They have brushed it aside as appears from the following passage in their judgment:\n\"We find that Abhji had eight injuries. Of these, one was on the head on the left parietal region. Four others were ordinary injuries on various other parts of the body. Sixth injury was bleeding from nostrils and left ear. This is really no independent injury for the bleeding must be due to the injury on the head. The seventh was a depression on the right and left parietal regions. This also appears to us to be the effect of injury No. 1 which caused the lacerated wound. The eighth was an internal injury, namely the fracture of the right and left parietal bones. It is obvious therefore that Abhji got only one blow on the head, and the witnesses are practically unanimous that it was given by Surjan.\"\nIt may be that it is not impossible that injuries 1 and 8 may be caused by one blow. If is also possible that the inquest report, Ex. P-16, which notes only one injury on the head describing it as \"an injury inflicted by a lathi near the top of the head\" is indicative of only one single blow on the head.\nBut the statement in the inquest report is not evidence by itself and it certainly cannot be pitted against the evidence of the medical witness given in Court. There is absolutely no material on the record on which the definite and categorical evidence of the medical witness that there were in fact two injuries on the head and that they could not be caused by a single blow could be discredited or ignored.\nWith respect, the learned Judges of the High Court in stating that \"it was obvious Abhji got only one blow on the head\" were acting not on evidence but on conjecture. In the circumstances the guilt of the accused Surjan must be determined on the footing that there were two injuries on the head of the deceased and that they were caused by two blows.\nAs there is no evidence as to who dealt the fatal blow, appellant Surjan must get the benefit of that state of the evidence. There was, therefore, no sufficient reason for the High Court to interfere with the acquittal of the appellant Surjan in respect of the alleged murderous assault by him.\nThe conviction of accused Surjan, therefore, under Section 304, Penal Code and the sentence of ten years' R. I. therefore cannot be maintained. His conviction by the Sessions Judge for an offence under Section 323, Penal Code and the sentence of one year R. I. therefore as confirmed by the High Court is maintained.\n12. In the result the appeal is dismiss ed except as regards the 'appellant Surjan. So far as he is concerned his conviction under Section 304, Penal Code and the sentence following thereupon are set aside and his conviction under Section 323, Penal Code and the sentence of one year's rigorous imprisonment therefore are, maintained.\n"}, {"id": "1377961", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Corporation Of Calcutta vs Mulchand Agarwalla on 17 November, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nCORPORATION OF CALCUTTA\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nMULCHAND AGARWALLA.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n17/11/1955\n\nBENCH:\nAIYYAR, T.L.

Naimunnisa Bibi and her sister, Khadija-ul-Kubra Bibi, since deceased, for partition of their shares in the estate of their father, Sheik Ataullah, who died sometime in 1892. The defendants to the action were their brothers, Sheik Kifayatullah and Sheik Mohammad Baqar.\nThe plaintiffs alleged that after the death of their father, Sheik Ataullah, they and the defendants were living together as members of one family, that the first defendant was in management of the properties on behalf of all of them, that on 10-8-1933 the defendants executed a deed of waqf-alal-aulad for the benefit of their descendants, and that the said deed was a denial of their rights. They accordingly prayed for partition and delivery of 14/48th share in the estate of the deceased Sheik Ataullah, which they claimed as belonging to them, for an account of the management of the same by the first defendant from 1892 and for future mesne profits from 2-2-1934.\nThe defendants contested the suit on three grounds, viz., (1) that there was a family custom excluding the female heirs from sharing in the inheritance, (2) that in 1893 there was a family settlement under which the plaintiffs gave up their rights to share in the estate, and (3) that the claim of the plaintiffs was extinguished by adverse possession on the part of the defendants, arid that the suit was barred by limitation.\n2. The Additional Subordinate Judge of Jaunpur who heard the suit, held by his judgment dated 14-5-1936 that the alleged custom was not made out, that there was, in fact, no family settlement, and that even if it were true, it would not be binding on the plaintiffs as they were minors at the date of the alleged settlement, and that the suit was not barred by limitation, as they had been at all times in enjoyment of the income from the properties.\nHe, however, held that the plaintiffs were entitled to 34/168th share in the estate of Sheik Ataullah and not 14/48th share as claimed in the plaint, and granted a decree for partition and possession of that share, and for rendition of accounts by the first defendant from 1892. The claim for future mesne profits was, however, negatived.\n3. Against this judgment, the defendants preferred an appeal to the High Court of Allahabad contending that the suit was liable to be dismissed on all the three grounds put forward in the trial Court, and further that the decree for rendition of accounts from 1892 was bad. The plaintiffs preferred a cross-appeal claiming that they were entitled also to their share of the profits from the estate from the date of the institution of the suit until they were put in separate possession.\nBy their judgment dated 22-10-1943 the learned Judges of the High Court agreed with the Subordinate Judge that the defendants had failed to establish the family custom excluding female heirs from inheritance, that further the family settlement which was alleged to have been entered into in 1893 was not proved, and that on the facts no question of limitation arose.\nThey, however, set aside the decree in so far as it directed rendition of accounts by the first defendant from 1892, but awarded the plaintiffs a decree for future mesne profits from the date of the plaint to be ascertained in further proceedings under Order 20, Rule 12. They also held -- and that was accepted by both parties -- that the correct share to which the plaintiffs were entitled was 153/672 and not 34/168, as decreed by the Subordinate Judge. It is against this judgment that the present appeal by the defendants is directed.\n4. Before considering the appeal on the merits, we have to deal with an application filed by the appellants under Order 23, Rule 3 for passing a decree in terms of an alleged compromise. According to them, the matters in dispute in the appeal were compromised on 12-9-1947, and the compromise was embodied in a document which is Record No. 1 in the Supplemental Record.\nIt must be mentioned that during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court the second plaintiff died leaving behind three sons and two daughters, and they were brought on record on 24-3-1938. One of these daughters, Zaina Bi, had subsequently died leaving behind, her husband, a son and daughter as her heirs, and they were brought on record on 29-7-1943.\nThe first defendant, Sheik Kifayatullah, died, and his three sons and two daughters were brought on record as his legal representatives on 4-1-1943. These were the persons who were interested in the subject-matter of the decree, which was under appeal.\nNow, the document on which the appellants rely as being the compromise is signed by the second defendant, Sheik Mohammad Baqar, but the heirs of the deceased first defendant are not parties thereto. On the side of the plaintiffs, the document purports to bear the thumb-impression of the first plaintiff, and of three of the children of the deceased second plaintiff, Mohammad Ibrahim, one of the sons of the second plaintiff, and the son and the daughter of the deceased Zainab Bi are not eo nomine parties to it.\nMohamed Ibrahim, having subsequently died, his three sons have been brought on record as his legal representatives, and they do not admit the genuineness of this document, and further contend that even if true, it is ineffective as neither the heirs of the deceased first defendant nor some of the heirs of the deceased second plaintiff are parties thereto.\nThey contend that as the compromise relates to a partition decree, and as under the proposed compromise the plaintiffs are to take as one group, it was impossible to give effect to that compromise, unless all the parties to the decree consented, and that as some of them have admittedly not joined in the compromise, it could not be made a rule of court under Order 23, Rule 3.\n5. In our opinion, the application must fail on the short ground that the compromise is not proved. The appellants applied to the High Court to have the compromise recorded and transmitted to this Court. In their application, they stated that the sons of the first defendant, though agreeable to the terms of the compromise at one stage, changed their mind later on.\nEven with reference to the parties whose names appeared on the document, as the compromise was not admitted the High Court called for a report from the Civil Judge, Jaunpur as to the truth thereof. But none of the parties turned up at the hearing before the Civil Judge though the matter was before him twice, with the result that he sent a report that the compromise had not been verified.\nThis report was accepted by the learned Judges in their order dated 29-7-1949. On the materials before us, there is no proof that there was any compromise between the parties, and the petition under Order 23, Rule 3 to pass a decree in terms of compromise must accordingly be dismissed.\n6. On the merits, two contentions have been pressed before us: (1) that the family custom excluding the females from taking as heirs must be held to be established, and (2) that the claim of the plaintiffs is barred by limitation. The burden of proving a custom in derogation of the general law being heavily on the party who sets it up, it was incumbent on the appellants to prove by clear and cogent evidence that there was such a custom as was pleaded by them.\nIt is admitted that there is no documentary evidence in support of it. The appellants examined six witnesses in proof of it. The trial Judge was not impressed by their evidence, and has given good reasons for rejecting it. No serious attempt appears to have been made before the High Court to rehabilitate them.\nThe strongest piece of evidence relied on by the appellants is on entry in the mutation of records made in 1893, in which it is stated that the daughters are excluded by custom from sharing in the inheritance, and that therefore the names of the sons of Ata-ullah alone are entered as his heirs. It appears from this very record that the source of this information was the first defendant himself, who at that time is stated to have been about 22 years old.\nIt is obvious that a statement as to custom from a person of that age cannot command much weight, as that must largely depend on his means of knowledge. In view of the fact that he was himself a person interested, his statement must be discarded as too slender for supporting the custom. We do not find any sufficient grounds for disturbing the concurrent findings of the Courts below on this point, and the custom pleaded by the defendants must, therefore, be held not to have been established.\n7. Then, there is the question of limitation. The parties to the action are co-sharers, and as under the law, possession of one co-sharer is possession of all co-sharers it cannot be adverse to them, unless there is a denial of their right to their knowledge by the person in possession, and exclusion and ouster following thereon for the statutory period.\nThe facts found are that the plaintiffs were minors at the time of their father's death, that they continued to live with their brothers in the same house down to the year 1918, that thereafter they went to reside with their husbands but that they continued to draw from the family chest for all expenses.\nThe Courts below have found that as the plaintiffs were in enjoyment of the income from the estate, there was no ouster, and that is clearly right. It was not until 1933 when the defendants executed the waqf deed that there was any denial of the title of the plaintiffs, and down to that date, they had been in enjoyment of the properties.\nIt was argued that what the plaintiffs received was only maintenance, and could not be attributed to their right to a share in the properties. But the evidence shows that the receipts were not merely for maintenance, and that they were of the same character as the receipts by the defendants themselves from the estate during this period. Moreover, there can be no question of ouster, if there is participation in the profits to any degree. On the facts found, therefore, no question of adverse possession arises.\n8. Both the contentions urged in support of the appeal fail, and the appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.\n"}, {"id": "197199", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Shri Virindar Kumar Satyawadi vs The State Of Punjab on 24 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

The appellant was a candidate for election to the House of the People from the Karnal Reserved Constituency during the last General Elections. The proviso to section 33(3) of the Representation of the People Act (XLIII of 1951), omitting what is not material, enacts \"that in a constituency where any seat is reserved for the Scheduled Castes, no candidate shall be deemed to be qualified to be chosen to fill that seat unless his nomination paper is accompanied by a declaration verified in the prescribed manner that the candidate is a member of the Scheduled Castes for which the sea has been so reserved and the declaration specifies the particular caste of which the candidate is a member and also the area in relation to which such caste is one of the Scheduled Castes\". Rule 6 of the Election Rule provides that the declaration referred to in the above proviso shall be verified by the candidate on oath or solemn affirmation before a Magistrate. Schedule II contains the form of nomination paper to be used, with the terms in which the declaration is to be made by the candidate and verified by the Magistrate. On 5-11-1951 the appellant signed two nomination papers each containing the following declaration : \n\"I hereby declare that I am a member of the Balmiki Caste which has been declared to be a Scheduled Caste in the State of Punjab\".  \n2. The Balmiki Caste is one of the castes declared to be a Scheduled Caste under the \"Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950\". The above declaration was made on solemn affirmation before the First Class Magistrate, Karnal, and the nomination papers with the above declaration were filed before the District Magistrate, Karnal, who was the returning officer. One Jai Ram Sarup, a member of the Chamar caste, which is one of the Scheduled Castes, was also a candidate for the seat, and he raised the objection that the appellant was not a Balmiki by caste, and that he was therefore not qualified to stand for election to the reserved Constituency. Acting on the declaration aforesaid, the returning officer overruled the objection, and accepted the nomination paper of the appellant as valid. At the polling, the appellant got the majority of votes, and on 6-3-1952 he was declared duly elected. \n3. On 27-8-1952 Jai Ram Sarup filed the application out of which the present appeal arises, under sections 476 and 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the District Magistrate, who functioned as the returning officer. He therein alleged that the declaration made by the appellant that he belonged to the Balmiki caste was false, that, in fact, he was born a Muslim and had been converted to Hinduism, and that therefore \"in the interests of justice\" and \"for safeguarding the interests of the Scheduled Castes\", proceedings should be taken for his prosecution. In his counter-affidavit the appellant stated : \n\"I am not a Muhammadan by birth. On the other hand, I was born in Balmiki Hindu family. I am a Hindu\".  \n4. The District Magistrate held an enquiry in which one Prith Singh Azad, President of the Depressed Classes, Delhi, gave evidence that the appellant was a Muslim of the name of Khaliq Sadiq, that in 1938 he applied to the Suddhi Sabha to be converted to Hinduism, that he was so converted, and that thereafter he came to be known as Virindar Kumar. In cross-examination, he stated that the appellant had admitted before him that he was a Muslim by birth. He added that he had two Muslim wives living at the time of the conversion. The applicant, Jai Ram Sarup, also produced ten letters stated to be in the handwriting of the appellant in proof of the above facts. On 17-9-1952 the Magistrate passed an order that there was a prima facie case for taking action, and on 29-9-1952 he filed a complaint before the First Class Magistrate, Karnal, charging the appellant with offences under sections 181, 182 and 193 of the Indian Penal Code. \n5. Against this order, the appellant preferred an appeal to the Court of the Sessions Judge, Karnal, who dismissed the same on the ground that the returning officer was not a Court, that the proceedings before him did not fall under section 476, and that therefore, no appeal lay under section 476-B. The appellant took the matter in revision before the High Court, Punjab, and that was heard by Harnam Singh J., who held, differing from the Sessions Judge, that the returning officer was a Court, and that his order was therefore appealable. He, however, held that on the merits there was no case for interference, and accordingly dismissed the revision. It is against this order that the present appeal by special leave is directed. \n6. On behalf of the appellant Mr. N. C. Chatterjee argues that having held that the order of the returning officer was appealable, the learned Judge ought to have remanded the case for hearing by the Sessions Judge on the merits, and that his own disposal of the matter was summary and perfunctory. The contention of Mr. Gopal Singh for the respondent is that the view of the Sessions Judge that the returning officer was not a court and that his order was not, therefore, appealable was correct, and that further the order of the High Court in revision declining to interfere on the merits was not liable to be questioned special appeal in this Court. \n7. The first question that arises for our decision is whether the order of the District Magistrate passed on 17-9-1952 as returning officer is open to appeal. The statutory provisions bearing on this point are sections 195, 476 and 476-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 195(1)(a) provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 of the Indian Penal Code except on the complaint in writing of the public officer concerned or of his superior. Section 195(1)(b) enacts that no Court shall take cognizance of the offence mentioned therein, where such offence is committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except on the complaint in writing of such Court or a Court which it is subordinate. The offence under section 193 is one of those mentioned in section 195(1)(b). Section 476 prescribes the procedure to be followed where a Court is moved to lay a complaint, and that applies only to offences mentioned in section 195(1)(b) and 195(1)(c) and not to those mentioned in section 195(1)(a). Section 476-B provides for an appeal from an order passed under section 476 to the appropriate Court. The result then is that if the complaint relates to offences mentioned in sections 195(1)(b) and 195(1)(c), an appeal would be competent, but not if it relates to offences mentioned in section 195(1)(a). Now, the order of the Magistrate dated 17-9-1952 directs that the appellant should be prosecuted for offences under sections 181, 182 and 193. There is no dispute that the order in so far as it relates to offences under sections 181 and 182 is not appealable, as they fall directly under section 195(1)(a). The controversy is only as regards the charge under section 193. Section 193 makes it an offence to give false evidence whether it be in a judicial proceeding or not, and it likewise makes it an offence to fabricate false evidence for use in a judicial proceeding or elsewhere. If the offence is not committed in a judicial proceeding, then it will fall outside section 195(1)(b), which applies only when it is committed in or in relation to a proceeding in Court, and there is in consequence no bar to a complaint being made in respect thereof unaffected by the restrictions contained in section 195(1)(b). But if the offence under section 193 is committed in or in relation to a proceedings in Court, to then it will fall under section 195(1)(b), and the order directing prosecution under section 476 will be appealable under section 476-B. The point for decision therefore is whether the returning officer in deciding on the validity of a nomination paper under section 36 of the Act can be held to act as a Court. The question thus raised does not appear to be covered by authority, and has to be decided on the true character of the functions of the returning officer and the nature and the extent of his powers. \n8. \"There has been much difference of opinion as to the precise character of the office of a returning officer, viz., as to whether he is a judicial or ministerial officer\", says Parker on Election Agent and Returning Officer, Fifth Edition, page 30. The true view, according to him, is that he partakes of both characters, and that in determining objections to nomination papers, he is a judicial officer. That is also the view taken in Indian decisions. But before we can hold that the proceedings before a returning officer resulting in the acceptance or rejection of a nomination paper fall within section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it must be shown not merely that they are judicial in character but that further he is acting as a Court in respect thereof. It is a familiar feature of modern legislation to set up bodies and tribunals, and entrust to them work of a judicial character, but they are not Courts in the accepted sense of that term, though they may possess, as observed by Lord Sankey, L. C. in Shell Company of Australia v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation ([1931] A.C. 275, 296), some of the trappings of a Court. The distinction between Courts and tribunals exercising quasi-judicial functions is well established, though whether an authority constituted by a particular enactment falls within one category or the other may, on the provisions of that enactment, be open to argument. \n9. There has been considerable discussion in the Courts in England and Australia as to what are the essential characteristics of a Court as distinguished from a tribunal exercising quasi-judicial functions. Vide Shell Company of Australia v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation ([1931] A.C. 275, 296), R. v. London Country Council ([1931] 2 K.B. 215), Cooper v. Wilson ([1937] 2 K.B. 309), Huddart Parker and Co. v. Moorehead ([1908] 8 C.L.R. 330), and Rola Co. v. The Commonwealth ([1944] 69 C.L.R. 185). In this Court, the question was considered in some fulness in Bharat Bank Ltd. v. Employees of Bharat Bank Ltd. ([1950] S.C.R. 459). It is unnecessary to traverse the same ground once again. In may be stated broadly that what distinguishes a Court from a quasi-judicial tribunal is that it is charged with a duty to decide disputes in a judicial manner and declare the rights of parties in a definitive judgment. To decide in a judicial manner involves that the parties are entitled as a matter of right to be heard in support of their claim and to adduce evidence in proof of it. And it also imports an obligation on the part of the authority to decide the matter on a consideration of the evidence adduced and in accordance with law. When a question therefore arises as to whether an authority created by an Act is a Court as distinguished from a quasi-judicial tribunal, what has to be decided is whether having regard to the provisions of the Act it possesses all the attributes of a Court. \n10. We have now to decide whether in view of the principles above stated and the functions and powers entrusted to the returning officer under the Act, he is a court. The statutory provision bearing on this is matter is section 36. Under section 36(2), the returning officer has to examine the nomination paper and decide all objections which may be made thereto. This power is undoubtedly judicial in character. But in exercising this power, he is authorised to come to a decision \"after such summary enquiry, if any, as he thinks necessary\". That means that the parties have no right to insist on producing evidence which they may desire to adduce in support of their case. There is no machinery provided for summoning of witnesses, or of compelling production of documents in an enquiry under section 36. The returning officer is entitled to act suo motu in the matter. When one compares this procedure with that prescribed for trial of election petitions by the Election Tribunal under sections 90 and 92 of the Act, the difference between the two becomes marked. While the proceedings before the Election Tribunal approximate in all essential matters to proceedings in civil courts, the proceedings under section 36 present a different picture. There is no lis, in which persons with opposing claims are entitled to have their rights adjudicated in a judicial manner, but an enquiry such as is usually conducted by an ad hoc tribunal entrusted with a quasi-judicial power. In other words, the function of the returning officer acting under section 36 in judicial in character, but he is not to act judicially in discharging it. We are of opinion that the returning officer deciding on the validity of a nomination paper is not a Court for the purpose of section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the result is that even as regards the charge under section 193, the order of the Magistrate was not appealable, as the offence was not committed in or in relation to any proceeding in a Court. In this view, the learned Sessions Judge was right in dismissing the appeal as incompetent, and the question argued by Mr. N. C. Chatterjee that the learned Judge of the High Court ought to have remanded the case for hearing by the Sessions Judge on the merits does not arise. \n11. It was next argued for the appellant that as the application for initiating prosecution under section 193 was made under section 476 on the assumption that the returning officer was a court, the order passed thereon must, in the view that he was not a Court, be quashed as without jurisdiction. But then, is should be noted that the application was presented under section 195 also, and it was necessary to move the returning officer under section 195(1)(a) with reference to the offences under sections 181 and 182, and there could be no question of quashing the order as without jurisdiction. Even as regards section 193, the position is this : It has no doubt been held that section 476 must be taken to be exhaustive of all the powers of a Court as such to lay a complaint, and that a complaint filed by it otherwise than under that section should not be entertained. But there is abundant authority that section 476 does not preclude the officer presiding over a Court from himself preferring a complaint, and that the jurisdiction of the Magistrate before whom the complaint is laid to try it like any other complaint is not taken away by that section. Vide Meher Singh v. Emperor (A.I.R. 1933 Lah. 884), Emperor v. Nanak Chand (A.I.R. 1943 Lah. 208), Har Prasad v. Emperor (A.I.R. 1947 A.ll. 139) and Channu Lal v. Rex ([1950] 51 Cr.L.J. 199). There is thus no legal impediment to a returning officer filing a complaint under sections 181 and 182 as provided in section 195(1)(a) and charging the accused therein with also an offence under section 193. In this connection, it should be mentioned that the appellant himself took the objection before the Magistrate that qua returning officer he was not a Court and that the proceedings under section 476 were incompetent, and that that was overruled on the ground that it was an enabling section. There is, therefore, no ground for holding that the order dated 17-9-1952 was without jurisdiction. \n12. It was finally contended that the Magistrate was under a misapprehension in stating that the appellant had declared that he was born a Balmiki, whereas, in fact, he only declared that he was a Balmiki by caste. But it was the appellant himself who pleaded in his counter-affidavit that he was not a Muslim by birth, and was born in a Balmiki Hindu family, and the observation of the Magistrate has obvious reference to what was pleaded and argued by the appellant. And it should also be noted that no objection was taken either in the grounds of appeal to the Sessions Court or in revision to the High Court with reference to the above remark. Moreover, the charge as laid in the complaint is that the declaration of the appellant in the nomination paper that he \"was a member of the Balmiki caste\" was false. There is accordingly no substance in this contention. \n13. It must be emphasised that in the view that the order of the Magistrate dated 17-9-1952 was final, this appeal being really directed against that order there must be exceptional grounds before we can interfere with it in special appeal, and none such has been established. On the other hand, whether action should be taken under section 195 is a matter primarily for the Court which hears the application, and its discretion is not to be lightly interfered with in appeal, even when that is competent. But where, as here, the legislature does not provide for an appeal, it is preposterous on the part of the appellant to invite this Court to interfere in special appeal. \n14. This appeal is accordingly dismissed. \n"}, {"id": "829084", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Shrimati Vidya Verma, Through ... vs Dr. Shiv Narain Verma on 11 November, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nSHRIMATI VIDYA VERMA, THROUGH NEXT FRIEND R.V.S.

The real question in this appeal is whether the conviction of the appellants under Sections 323 and 326 read with Section 34, Penal Code is legal in the circumstances of the present case. The Magistrate, who tried the appellants framed a charge under Sections 148, 323 and 326 read with Section 149, Penal Code. He found them and seven others guilty of this charge and convicted them accordingly. The Second Additional Sessions Judge of Meerut, in appeal, acquitted all the accused except the appellants whose conviction ho maintained but reduced their sentence.\nThe appellants moved the High Court of Allahabad in its revisional jurisdiction and the High Court held that as a result of the Additional Sessions Judge's judgment the appellants could not be convicted under Section 148 or Sections 323 and 326 read with Section 149, Penal Code as the ingredients to establish the existence of an unlawful assembly were absent. The High Court, however, convicted the appellants under Sections 323 and 326 read with Section 34, Penal Code and it is against this decision that the appellants obtained special leave to appeal to this Court.\n2. There were two versions of the occurrence before the Courts below and that of the prosecution, except as to who had participated in it, was accepted and the defence version was rejected. The case of the prosecution as accepted shows that the complainant Randhir Singh was passing the 'Chari' field of the appellants with his bullocks when he was asked by them as to why his bullocks had grazed the 'Chari.' The complainant denied this, whereupon after some altercation, he was assaulted by the appellants with lathis and a spear. He received injuries from the lathi blows but was able to run away raising an alarm. He was followed by the appellants.\nAfter he had gone some distance, some persons came to his help. The complainant and these persons were assaulted by the appellants who had come up by then. The story of the prosecution which had not been accepted is this that previous to this 8 other persons had also come and they and the appellants together assaulted the complainant and his men.\n3. Mr. Isaacs for the appellants, has argued that the occurrence which took place on 15-10-1949 consisted of 2 incidents -- one near the 'Chari' field of the appellants and the other some distance away, when the complainant is said to have been assaulted by several persons including the appellants who are said to have been members of an unlawful assembly. All those persons had been acquitted except the appellants and there was nothing to show that there was any previous concert between the appellants and the acquitted accused. At the second incident several persons had come up suddenly and there was nothing to show that the assault took place as a result of a prepared plan between them and the appellants.\nAccordingly the appellants could not be convicted by the application of Section 34, Penal Code. He relied upon the decision of the Privy Council in -- 'Mahbub Shah v. King Emperor',  as well as, on the decision of this Court in --Pandurang v. State of Hyderabad', . He urged that before the provisions of Section 34, Penal Code could apply the prosecution had to prove that there was a common intention and that it was insufficient to show that the appellants had the same or similar intention. He also urged that as the prosecution case had been substantially rejected in that 8 out of the 11 accused had been acquitted, the appellants should not have been convicted on the same evidence which was unreliable so far as the rest of the accused were concerned.\n4. In an appeal by way of special leave this Court usually does not interfere with the findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below and nothing substantial has been shown to persuade us to go behind the findings of fact arrived at by them.\n5. It is unnecessary to refer to the various decisions of this Court and of the Privy Council cited by Mr. Isaacs, which deal with Section 34, Penal Code, because on the findings in this case, there can be no doubt that the provisions of Section 34, Penal Code apply. As between the version of the prosecution and that of the defence, the version of the prosecution had been accepted by the Courts below. It is true that so far as individual participation is concerned, most of the accused had been acquitted. Nonetheless, the version of the occurrence as given by the prosecution had been accepted. According to that Version it was the three appellants who attacked Randhir Singh in the first incident.\nIn this incident certain injuries were suffered by Randhir Singh, although no injury was caused by a spear. Randhir Singh ran away followed by the appellants. Whether he or his companions were or were not attacked by a large number of persons at the second incident, the findings make it clear that they were attacked by the 3 appellants. It seems, therefore, that the appellants were actuated by a common intention to assault the complainant and his men and this inference is justified from the circumstances. They did assault the complainant in the first incident. They pursued the. complainant and they persisted in assaulting him and those who had come to his help. The clear implication of this is that the assault in the second incident was the result of previous concert.\nThe High Court found that the common object charged was identical with the common intention and it seems that the evidence to prove the common intention was the same which would have proved the. common object, if it had been established that there had been an unlawful assembly. In our opinion, the decision of this Court in --\"'Karnail Singh v. State or Punjab', 1954 SC 204 (AIR V 41) (C) and the observations of Fazl Ali J. in -- 'Lachman Singh v. The State',  entirely cover the present case.\n6. It is true that out of 11 accused persons 8 have been acquitted and this may support the argument that the prosecution witnesses were unreliable. It was, however, for the Courts of fact to determine as to whether they would accept the prosecution evidence concerning the part played by the appellants in the occurrence in spite of this. As to whether the witnesses should or should not be believed is prima facie a mutter for the courts of fact to determine.\nAs already stated there is nothing exceptional in the circumstances of the present case to justify us in supposing that any miscarriage of justice has taken place. Whatever doubts there might have been about the participation of other persons in the occurrence, the participation of the appellants in the occurrence was proved beyond reasonable doubt.\n7.

The appellant Chhutanni has been condemned to death in two separate trials for the murder respectively of his wife, Gunga and his cousin, Chhanga. Gunga was aged about 40 years according to the medical evidence and about 50 years according to the defence, which seems to be nearer the truth as she was the mother of three daughters who are all married, the second daughter having been married to Gokaran Pasi and having a child aged about five years.\nGokaran is also said to have joined his father-in-law, the appellant, in murdering both Gunga and Chhanga. The deceased Chhanga was aged, according to the prosecution, about 28 years, and according to the defence, about 20 years. It appears that the appellant Chhutanni having no son of his own, inducted Chhanga into the family more as a member than as an employee, though his father would make it out that he was in the appellant's service.\nBetween Chhanga and Gunga an illicit intimacy appears to have developed with the result that some months before the date of the occurrence, i.e., 17-1-1954, Gunga left her husband's protection and house and went away with her paramour Chhanga. The old man finding himself without a household assistant prevailed upon his wife and Chhanga to come back to his home on the promise, it is said, of leaving his property by will to both of them and of sharing his wife with Chhanga.\nIn pursuance of the promise he executed a will bearing date November 3, 1953, bequeathing his property to both of them. He is even said to have shared his wife's bed on alternate nights with Chhanga. At about 7 o'clock in the morning of 18-1-1954 Chhanga's father, Mansukhi, lodged a first information report at police station Biswan, district Sitapur, which was recorded in his own words. That information sets out in a nutshell the whole prosecution case and may therefore be reproduced as follows :\n\"I live in village Dhaukalganj. My son Chhanga was in the service of Chhutanni Pasi of the village, son of Maiku for the last three years. Chhanga contracted illicit intimacy with the wife of Chhutanni. Three months ago he abducted her away. A fortnight after the abduction Chhutanni brought back his wife and my son after beating and said to Chhanga, 'you live in my house as master. My wife shall cook food and both of us shall eat. She would live one night with me and one night with you in your house (turn by turn). I shall have all my property bequeathed in your favour and in favour of my wife'.\nChhutanni executed a will: in favour of both in the Panchayat of Dhaukalganj. Whatever Chhutanni had said the same was being acted upon. Yesterday one pahar after nightfall Chhutanni took Chhanga from my house saying that they would bring wood from Murkatta.\nMy son Vishwanath had gone to look to his Bambiha field in the same direction. He heard Chhanga shouting 'Run, Chhutanni and Gokaran, etc. are killing me.' My son Vishwanath ran up to him raising alarm. Lalji Sonar, Razzaq Pathan and Chhunni Kalwar of the village who had gone to see their fields ran up and raised alarm and saw Chhutanni, his son-in-law Gokaran and his brother-in-law Kalika assaulting Chhanga after felling him down and running away. Chhutanni was holding a gandasa.\nSeeing that Chhanga's neck was cut and bleeding and that he was unable to speak Vishwanath sent for me through Lalji Sonar. Then I and my son Chiranju along with Lalji Sonar went to Murkatta and saw Chhanga cut by the neck and dead. The cap of Chhutanni was found lying at the same place which I have brought. I file the same. When I brought the corpse of Chhanga to the door of Chhutanni, Ram Narain Brahman, Bhagwan Din Brahman, Duiney Pasi and other persons of the village met me at the door of Chhutanni and told me 'Chhutanni and Gokaran ran away after cutting Manjhli wife of Chhutanni. On the alarm being raised we and others came up and saw (the occurrence) and on our arrival and reprimanding Chhutanni etc., ran away by jumping over the wall (danrwaz)'.\nOne gandasa and one scythe smeared with blood were lying near the corpse. I, along with the chaukidar have come to lodge a report after leaving the corpse of Chhanga in the charge of Chiranju and that of the wife of Chhutanni in the charge of Chheddu Bisardar.\nI lodge a complaint against Chhutanni Pasi of the village, Gokaran Pasi of Tendwa and Kalika Pasi of Lachhmanpur for killing my son Chhanga. The report was read over to me. Whatever I got recorded the same was taken down. It is correct. I affix my thumb impression.\"\n2. Though this first information report complains of the murder of the informant's son, it contains information about the murder of the appellant's wife also. The time of the occurrence is stated in that report as \"one pahar after nightfall\", which would be between 8 and 9 P.M. But as the information was lodged by an illiterate person belonging to the Pasi caste and as Chhanga was decoyed at about that time, the occurrence might have taken place shortly after that time.\nThe Sub-Inspector of Police arrived at the scene of occurrence 11 miles distant from the police station, at about 11 A.M. He sent the dead bodies for post-mortem examination, took charge of the bloodstained earth in the field of Chandra Bhal where Chhanga is said to have been murdered and seized the gandasa (Ex. II) and hasia (Ex. III) from the barotha (entrance hall) of Chhutanni's house. He also prepared site plans of the two scenes of occurrence.\nAfter police investigation the three persons named in the first information report as the culprits were placed before the Magistrate holding the enquiry preliminary to their commitment before the Court of Session. Until the committal stage the case was treated as one, but the learned Sessions Judge on receipt of the commitment order decided that the cases should be tried separately.\nHence the charge of murder in respect of Chhanga formed the subject-matter of Sessions Trial No. 103 of 1954 held by the District and Sessions Judge of Sitapur, which we shall call the first trial, and the charge of murder in respect of Gunga alias Manjhli formed the subject-matter of Sessions Trial No. 147 of 1954 which was held by the Temporary Civil and Sessions Judge of Sitapur, which we shall call the second trial. The judgment in the first trial is dated 14-10-1954 and that in the second is dated 18-12-1954.\n3. The post-mortem examination of Chhanga deceased disclosed three incised wounds on the front side of the neck, and on the left and right sides of the lower jaw. On internal examination it was found that the middle ribs of both sides had been fractured and the heart was ruptured. According to the doctor,\n \"Death was due to shock and haemorrhage, from the division of the main vessels of the neck in injury No. 1 by some sharp cutting weapon ..... Injuries Nos. 1 to 3 could be caused by the gandasa Ex. II just now shown to me. The ribs were fractured and could be caused if some one sits and presses on the chest.\"\nThe post-mortem examination of Gunga disclosed eight incised wounds, the most serious of which were on the front part of the neck dividing the trachea, the main vessels of the neck on both sides cutting the oesophagus, besides three other incised wounds in the region of the neck with the result that, according to the medical evidence, death was due to shock and haemorrhage from the division of the main vessels of the neck by some sharp edged cutting weapon. The doctor repeated that the incised wounds could be caused by a gandasa like Ex. II.\n4. In the first trial Chhutanni, Kalika and Gokaran were the accused persons. Apart from the formal evidence, the case against the three accused rested on the direct testimony of three alleged eye-witnesses, namely, Vishwanath, brother of Chhanga deceased, Chhunni and Razzak (P. Ws. 5 to 7).\nThe evidence of these three eye-witnesses is to the effect that they were, on the night of the occurrence, guarding their gram and pea crops against the ravages of wild animals, like, neelgai. Their fields surround the field of Chandra Bhal in which the gram crop was standing at the time and where Chhanga was said to have been murdered. They claim to have reached the place at the nick of the time on hearing the shrieks of Chhanga that he was being done to death. They claim to have seen Chhutanni sitting on the chest of Chhanga and giving gandasa blows on the neck and the other two accused holding the victim down by the head and the feet.\nThe learned Sessions Judge relying upon their direct testimony, corroborated by the nature of the injuries found on the person of Chhanga, and the existence of strong motive to get him out of their way convicted the accused persons under Section 302/34, Indian Penal Code and sentenced Chhutanni to death and the other two to transportation for life.\n5. In the second trial only two of the accused, viz., Chhutanni and Gokaran figured as the accused persons. The learned Temporary Civil and Sessions Judge of Sitapur found it proved on the testimony of the alleged three eye-witnesses, Ram Narain (P. W. 3), Bhagwan Din (P. W. 4) and Dhina (P. W. 7) that Chhutanni dealt gandasa blows while sitting on the chest of the deceased Gunga, while Gokaran pressed her down.\nThe learned Judge examined all the contentions raised on behalf of the accused persons challenging the direct testimony of those eye-witnesses and came to the conclusion that those witnesses were independent and reliable. Accordingly he convicted them both under Section 302/34, Indian Penal Code and sentenced Chhutanni to death and Gokaran to transportation for life.\n6. Against these orders of convictions and sentences aforesaid in the first trial Criminal Appeal No. 759 of 1954 was preferred and was heard along with Capital Sentence Reference No. 43 of 1954 by the Luck-now Bench of the Allahabad High Court (Kidwai and Mulla JJ.)\n \n\nThe learned Judges refused to act upon the testimony of the three eye-witnesses, Vishwanath, Chhunni and Razzak and relying upon the evidence of Lalji, one of the persons admitted by the prosecution to have witnessed the occurrence but who was examined as a defence witness, acquitted Kalika and Gokaran and directed the immediate release of Kalika. But they did not direct the release of Gokaran as his conviction and sentence in the second trial, as will presently appear, were maintained by the High Court also.\nThe learned Judges dismissed the appeal of Chhutanni and confirmed the death sentence passed upon him, relying mainly on circumstantial evidence.\nThe circumstances mainly relied upon by them as against Chhutanni were that he had decoyed Chhanga from his father's house that night on the pretext of going out for collecting some wood in the neighbourhood; that soon after that Chhanga was found dead; that homicidal injuries were found on the front part of his neck which were more or less of the same character as the injuries found on the dead body of Chhutanni's wife caused by the same kind of weapon and in the same manner at about the same time and that a bloodstained gandasa had been recovered which according to the doctor's evidence could have caused the injuries on the deceased. They also observed that so many coincidences in the modus operandi in respect of the two occurrences could not be said to be accidental.\nThis judgment was given on 6-4-1955. Just a day before, on 5-4-1955, they had heard the appeal from the orders of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court in the second trial. It was Criminal Appeal No. 915 of 1954, which was heard along with Capital Sentence Reference No. 10 of 1955 by the same Bench.\nThe learned Judges agreed with the trial Judge in accepting the evidence of the three eye-witnesses aforesaid. They also agreed that there was sufficient motive for the appellants in that case to commit the crime. They found that illicit intimacy could spring up on account of there being sufficient proximity and opportunity and that there was nothing surprising that there was a liaison between Chhanga and the woman Gunga, who was about twenty years his senior. They repelled the contention of the appellant that the story of the illicit intimacy was unbelievable.\nThe fact that Chhanga was a young man, who though married for four or five years before his death, had not the company of his wife, lent additional support to the prosecution case that there was such an intimacy between the two persons who were almost simultaneously done to death. They also found that the admitted execution of the will by the appellant Chhutanni in favour of the two victims and the agreement to share the woman were mere pretences to lull the victims into security. They also found that Gokaran, Chhutanni's son-in-law, would be naturally interested in getting rid of both those persons because so long as they were alive and the will in their favour stood, his wife and child would have no chance of succession to Chhutanni's property.\nThus in complete agreement with the findings of the trial Judge the High Court confirmed the convictions and the sentences passed upon the appellants as aforesaid and dismissed the appeal.\n7. These appeals have been brought to this Court by special leave granted by the Vacation Judge on 18-7-1955. It is convenient first to dispose of the appeal directed against the orders of conviction and sentence in the second trial relating to the murder of Gunga because our orders in that appeal will naturally have a repercussion on the result of the first trial.\nIn both the trials Chhutanni has been sentenced to death for the two murders aforesaid. If his sentence of death were to be maintained as a result of the second trial, the appeal arising out of the first trial will be of no practical interest to the appellant because he is the only person convicted and sentenced to death as a result of the judgment of the High Court on appeal.\n8. The conviction of the appellant as a result of the second trial rests mainly on the testimony of the eye-witnesses, Ram Narain (P. W. 3), Bhagwan Din (P. W. 4), and Dhina (P. W. 7). From the sketch map prepared by the investigating police officer it appears that the houses of those three witnesses are situate in the neighbourhood of the house of the appellant Chhutanni.\nThe Courts below were therefore justified in treating them as competent witnesses who could have heard the shrieks of the woman who was being butchered inside the house. No such animosity as would lead those witnesses to depose falsely against the appellant had been brought out in their cross-examination. The Courts below having carefully examined and accepted that evidence directly incriminating the appellant, this Court on special leave will not ordinarily go behind their findings. The arguments which were advanced before the Courts below for rejecting the direct testimony of those witnesses were repeated before us and we do not think that any grounds have been made out for interference with the concurrent findings of the Courts below, assuming that we could do so on appeal by special leave.\nAdmittedly no question of law has been raised nor is there any suggestion that there had been a failure of justice by any defect in the procedure adopted, except suggesting that the appellant had been prejudiced by being tried in two separate proceedings. It was suggested that if all the accused had been tried at the same trial it may be that the High Court would have rejected the direct testimony of the three eye-witnesses even as it did in the case of the appellants in the other appeal. But clearly there is no substance in this contention.\nIn the first instance, the learned Sessions Judge out of abundant caution separated the trial in respect of the two murders to obviate any objections that might have been taken to a joint trial on the ground that the two murders had  taken place  at  different places.   It is not necessary for  us to pronounce at this stage on the wisdom of the course adopted in holding two separate trials. There is no illegality or irregularity in holding separate trials of the same accused persons even in cases where a single trial could have  been permissible  under the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nThe learned Sessions Judge chose the lesser of the two evils by directing two separate trials. Secondly, the same learned Judges heard both the appeals one after the other and naturally therefore, considered the case against the appellants in both the trials on its merits. The fact that they refused to act on the testimony of the three eye-witnesses in the first trial could not and did not have any effect on the testimony of the eyewitnesses examined in the second trial.\nThe two sets of witnesses were deposing to two different occurrences, though it may be that two of the accused were common to both the incidents which could be said to have been parts of the same transaction in the sense that the same motive operated and impelled the accused to perpetrate those crimes.   Nothing has been said before us  which could lead us to the  conclusion that there has been any failure of justice in the second trial.   This appeal must therefore stand dismissed.\n9. Coming to the appeal relating to the first trial, only the appellant Chhutanni has been sentenced to death for the murder of his cousin Chhanga. If the case stood by itself, then it could have been plausibly argued that the circumstances on which the High Court relied for convicting him were not conclusive. But the High Court has pointed out so many similarities in the two occurrences resulting in the death of the two persons as to eliminate the theory of accidental coincidences.\nThe appellant had a very strong motive to get Chhanga out of his way, because he had disgraced him in the eyes of his villagers. It was the appellant who decoyed him on that winter night of 17-1-1954 on the pretext of going out to bring wood. Chhanga was found dead soon after his going out with the appellant. The appellant did not offer any explanation as to what happened to his companion whom he had taken out that night.\nOn the other hand, bloodstained weapon had been recovered from his house which according to the medical evidence, could have been used for causing the death. Thus viewing the facts and circumstances disclosed in the evidence against the appellant, it is reasonably clear that he was chiefly instrumental in causing the death of the deceased Chhanga, although it may be true that he could not have perhaps done it single handed. He might have had the assistance of one or two more persons keeping in view the fact that the deceased was a much younger man in the prime of his youth and could not have been easily overpowered by the appellant who was in his declining years.\nIt is not necessary for us to examine the case against those two accused who have been acquitted by the High Court and had been tried along with the appellant for the murder of Chhanga. But so far as the appellant is concerned, he seems to have acted in the way he did as a result of a premeditated plan to get rid of both his wife and her paramour.\n10. For the aforesaid reasons both the  appeals are dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "1135543", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Laxmi Narain Kalra vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 25 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Allahabad confirming the conviction of the appellant by the two courts below on a charge under Section 420, Indian Penal Code. In response to a notice dated 4th November, 1949, the District Development Officer, Etawah, inviting tenders for the supply of bricks in connection with a Flood Relief Housing Scheme, the appellant made a tender which was accepted and he was required to deposit in accordance with the rules, a sum of Rs. 4,000/- by way of security. Accordingly, on the 17th of November, 1949, he delivered a cheque dated 16th November for Rs. 4,000/- drawn on the Punjab National Bank Ltd., Kanpur, while in fact there was only a sum of Rs. 5/- to his credit on that date.\nIt must be noted that according to Clause 11 of Ex. P-2, which prescribes the procedure to be adopted in the matter of acceptance of tenders, the deposit should be in cash or postal securities. The cheque presented by the appellant, therefore, could not have been accepted by the authorities acting under that rule. On the 21st of November, 1949, the Development Officer returned the cheque asking the appellant to deposit cash as required by the rule. At that time the appellant was not in station and his brother, one Sobhraj, went, 011 the 22nd November, to the Development Officer and staled as follows :\n  \"Laxmi Narain has gone out. On his return the money will be deposited. If the District Development Officer so desired, he could have the cheque cashed.\" \n2. On this representation the cheque was sent for encashment and was dishonoured. The charge against the appellant is that in giving the cheque on 17-11-1949, and in re-presenting it on the 22nd of November, 1949, when there was admittedly only a sum of Rs. 5 to his credit in the Bank, he had cheated the authorities and had committed an offence punishable under Section 420, Indian Penal Code.\n3. The Additional District Magistrate, Kanpur, who tried the case, held that the offence had been made out and convicted the appellant and sentenced him to one year's rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000/-. The appellant took the matter in. appeal to the Court of the Sessions Judge, Kanpur, who affirmed the conviction and the sentence passed by the Additional District Magistrate.\nThere was a revision preferred to the High Court against the order of the Sessions Judge, and that was heard by Sankar Saran J. who observed that, on the facts, \"the appellant was not a cheat as cheating is generally understood in common parlance\" and that \"he was a victim of circumstances\", but held that technically the offence had been established and he accordingly confirmed the conviction. He however reduced the term of imprisonment to the period already undergone, but confirmed the fine. It is against this order that the present appeal has been filed by special leave.\n4. On the materials placed before us we are of opinion that the conviction under Section 420 cannot be sustained. We start with the fact that on the 17th November, the appellant presented a cheque when he had only Rs. 5/- to his credit in the bank account. Now under the rules, the railway receipts for coal could be handed over to the appellant only after the deposit had been made and as under Clause 11, the cheque could not be accepted as security by the department, the railway receipts could not in the normal course be delivered on the strength of the cheque and therefore there could be no question of the cheque having been delivered with any dishonest intention.\nThis is not seriously disputed by the respondent. The fact appears to be that the appellant had not the requisite amount for making a deposit and was making arrangements to raise the same. He wanted time and gave the cheque with that object. As a business man, he must have known that the officers had no authority to accept the cheque as security, and having regard to the usual course of business he would have expected the cheque to be returned.\nThis is indeed what happened on 21st November, 1949, when the Department wrote to him that the cheque could not be accepted and that he should deposit the amount in cash. Thus far, there is nothing to support any charge of cheating. Even the cheque, the delivery of which on the 17th of November is the foundation for this charge, had been returned unaccepted by the Department and therefore there was mo question of cheating.\n5. Now we must turn to what happened on the 22nd November, 1949. On that day the appellant was not in station. He had gone to arrange for the amount. It is stated that large amounts were due to him by the Railways, much more than four thousand rupees and it is therefore probable that he was away for raising the funds for making the deposit. When the letter dated 21st November was received, he not having been there, his brother Sobhraj, who it, is stated was also interested in the business, took it into his head to see P. W. 2 on the 22nd and make the representation which has already been mentioned.\nNow assuming for the purpose of the present appeal that Sobhraj was actuated by dishonest intention in making those representations, the question is whether the appellant could be fixed with responsibility for those representations and whether dishonest intention could be imputed to him. There is absolutely no evidence that he sent his brother on this errand with authority to make these representations. On the 22nd November he was not in the station and it is obvious that in his absence, his brother Sobhraj did what he thought was best in the circumstances and therefore there is no ground for holding the appellant responsible for the representations made by him.\n6. On behalf of the respondent, Mr. Asthana drew our attention to some passages in the evidence of P. Ws. 2 and 3 as showing that Sobhraj was acting under the authorisation of the appellant. P. W. 2 stated in his examination-in-chief that on the 15th November, 1949, Laxmi Narain had told him that Sobhraj was his brother and \"that he would come and go in his place as he was engaged in contracts outside at several places.\"\nFrom this it is sought to be argued that a general authority had been given by the appellant to his brother to act for him and that authority included making the representations which he actually did make. We find it very difficult to accept this argument In cross-examination P. W. 2 admitted that no writing was taken to show that Sobhraj could work on behalf of the appellant and such a general statement, as is spoken to by him is, in our opinion, wholly insufficient to constitute Sobhraj the authorised representative of the appellant for the purpose of making those representations.\nP. W. 3 stated in his evidence that in the beginning Laxmi Narain and Sobhraj both came to him together on the 15th and 16th November and they also came together sometimes even later on. This has little significance seeing that they were brothers and were connected in business. On the other hand, P. W. 3 said in cross-examination that on the 22nd of November, 1949, Sobhraj informed him that Laxmi Narain would come the following day. This appears to us to show that Sobhraj did not possess any authority to make representations on his own responsibility in the matter and that the matter was one for the final decision of Laxmi Narain. We are unable, on this evidence, to hold that Sobhraj had been authorised to make the representations which he did make on behalf \"of the appellant.\n7. There is no other evidence connecting the appellant with what happened on the 22nd of November 1949. That being so, there is no material on which we can say that the appellant has done anything which brings him within Section 420of the Penal. Code. His conviction under that section must accordingly be quashed.\n8. This appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence passed by the   courts below set aside. The fine is stated to have been paid and will be refunded.\n"}, {"id": "1136429", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "In Re: D An Advocate Of The Supreme ... vs Unknown on 23 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

This Rule was issued by this Court under Order IV, rule 30 of the Rules of this Court after receipt of a report from the Bombay High Court that that High Court had, by its order made on the 13th October, 1955 in Civil Application No. 1506 of 1955, suspended the respondent from practice as an Advocate of that High Court for a period of one year from the date of the said order. By the rule the respondent has been required to show cause why, in view of the matter specified in the judgment and order of the Bombay High Court referred to above, appropriate action, disciplinary or otherwise, should not be taken against him by this Court. \n2. The respondent is an Advocate of some standing in the Bombay High Court and as such was also enrolled as an Advocate of this Court. It appears that in the earlier part of the year 1953 the Advocate was prosecuted before Mr. Sonavane, one of the Presidency Magistrates at Bombay, on a charge of having committed an offence under the Bombay Prohibition Act. The trial lasted from July 1953 to November 1953. On the 18th November, 1953 the Magistrate convicted the Advocate of the offence with which he was charged and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for one month and to a fine of Rs. 201 and to rigorous imprisonment of four weeks in default of payment of the fine. The Advocate went up on appeal to the High Court. The High Court on the 24th February, 1954 upheld the conviction but altered the sentence to one of fine of Rs. 1,000 only. \n3. In the meantime, on the 25th November, 1953, the trial Magistrate, Mr. Sonavane, made a report to the Registrar (Appellate Side) of the Bombay High Court as to the conduct of the Advocate who appeared in person as the accused before him. On a perusal of that report the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court constituted a Tribunal consisting of three members of the Bar Council to enquire into the conduct of the Advocate. The Tribunal issued a summons against the Advocate intimating that it would enquire into his conduct as disclosed in :- \n(a) the report dated the 25th November, 1953, of Shri T. A. Sonavane, B.A. LL.B., Presidency Magistrate, 18th Court, Girgaum, Bombay, to the Registrar, High Court, Appellate Side, Bombay, regarding Case No. 593/P of 1953 tried by him, and \n \n\n(b) the judgment recorded by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Criminal Appeal No. 1532 of 1953 (with Criminal Appeal No. 1564 of 1953) upholding the judgment and order of conviction passed against him by the aforesaid learned Magistrate in the aforesaid case.  \n4. The proceedings appear to have been somewhat protracted by reason of frequent objections made and petitions filed by the respondent but eventually on or about the 16th March, 1955 the respondent forwarded to the Secretary to the Bar Council Tribunal a copy of a letter addressed by him to the Registrar, High Court, Bombay, and requested the Tribunal to send a report to the High Court in terms of his pleading guilty to the charges leveled against him. He concluded the letter by expressing regret for having wasted the time of the Tribunal. In his letter to the Registrar, the respondent enclosed a separate written apology unconditionally withdrawing his contention that the proceedings before the Tribunal were misconceived in law and admitting that the High Court had full authority in law to refer the matter to the Bar Council Tribunal and further that the statements made by Mr. Sonavane in his report were true except in two respects therein specified. On the 28th March, 1955 the respondent submitted an additional statement clarifying and supplementing his previous apology. Thereupon the Tribunal made a report to the High Court. By this report the Tribunal held, on the respondent's own admission, the allegations in the report of Mr. Sonavane to be proved and recommended that a very serious notice should be taken of the respondent's conduct. As regards the second item in the summons the Tribunal held that the mere conviction of the respondent under the Prohibition Act did not amount to professional or other misconduct under section 10 of the Indian Bar Councils Act and, therefore, found him not guilty of that charge. \n5. On a perusal of that report the High Court issued notice to the respondent for final hearing of the matter. The matter came up for final disposal before a Bench consisting of the Chief Justice and Tendolkar, J. on 13th October, 1955. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent offered an unconditional and unqualified apology on behalf of the respondent and pleaded that the ends of justice would be met if the Court only administered a warning to the respondent. After considering the report of the Tribunal the High Court took the view that the misconduct of the respondent was so serious and so grave that a deterrent punishment must be imposed on him. Accordingly, taking everything into consideration, the High Court suspended the respondent from practice for a period of one year from the date of that order. The respondent's application for a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court having been refused, the respondent filed a petition for special leave to appeal before us. That petition has, however, been dismissed by us. The rule for disciplinary action now remains to be dealt with. \n6. In answer to the rule the respondent has filed a petition by way of showing cause. Paragraph 7 of that petition runs as follows :- \n  \"7. That the report of the learned Presidency Magistrate, 18th Court, is a highly exaggerated, garbled and manifestly incorrect version of the incidents that occurred during the trial of the case. And looking to the circumstances under which the petitioner was more or less compelled to tender a humiliating apology, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to direct that a proper inquiry be held in the matter by or under the directions of this Hon'ble Court\".  \n7. Appearing in person before us the respondent has contended with a certain amount of vehemence that he had not had any fair deal before the Tribunal, that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to enter upon the enquiry inasmuch as the misconduct complained of was not committed by him in his capacity as an Advocate, for he appeared in person as the accused in the Prohibition case, that the Tribunal had at one stage held that it had no jurisdiction but had without giving him a hearing gone back on that decision and declined to decide that question in his presence, that the Tribunal failed to formulate any formal charge, that he made an application to the High Court under article 227 for quashing the proceedings for want of jurisdiction but the High Court had rejected that application and declined to give him a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court and pointed out various other matters which he characterised as showing prejudice and bias on the part of the Tribunal. \n8. It was pointed out to the respondent that his application for special leave to appeal from the judgment and order of the High Court having been dismissed we were not, in this Rule, concerned with the proceedings in the Bombay High Court or before the Tribunal of the Bar Council as observed by this Court in In the matter of Mr. G, a Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court . The respondent then fell back upon paragraph 7 of his petition quoted above and asked this Court to hold a fresh enquiry into the matter. From the judgment of the Bombay High Court which is referred to in the Rule issued herein it appears that the respondent had admitted the truth of everything contained in Mr. Sonavane's report except two matters only. In his present petition showing cause he does not, apart from a vague allegation that the report is an exaggerated, garbled and manifestly incorrect version of the incidents that occurred during the trial of the case, refer to and particular statement therein which is exaggerated garbled or incorrect. In view of his unconditional admission of the truth of the statements in the report of Mr. Sonavane we are not prepared to permit him to go back on the same on such vague allegations as are to be found in paragraph 7 of his petition. It is needless for us to emphasise that a person holding the responsible position of an Advocate of a High Court and of this Court cannot be permitted to play with the Court in the way this Advocate has done. He admitted the correctness of the report, confessed his guilt and tendered an unconditional apology evidently in the hope that he would get away with it by merely tendering an apology. Finding that the tactics did not work with the High Court as he expected the same to do, he now wants to charge his tactics by asking for an enquiry which he had himself avoided by means of his admission and apology. This we are not prepared to permit to do. We have carefully gone through the report of Mr. Sonavane and we find ourselves in entire agreement with the High Court when it says that that report makes an extremely sad reading. The conduct of the respondent in the criminal trial was, as pointed out by the High Court, entirely indefensible by any standard. It discloses a continuous and persistent attempt on the part of the respondent to be rude to and contemptuous of the Magistrate, to hold up the trial and to do everything in his power to bring the administration of justice into contempt. Such a conduct, in our opinion, merits severe condemnation. \n9. The respondent has drawn our attention to the case of In re Thomas James Wallace ([1866] L.R. 1 P.C. 283), which was followed in In re An Advocate of Benares . We do not conceive that the Privy Council intended to lay down any fixed and rigid rule of law or did anything more than indicate the course which, in the circumstances of that case, it considered to be reasonable, satisfactory and convenient and the Allahabad case simply followed the same. As has been held by a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in The Advocate-General of Bombay v. Three Advocates ([1934] I.L.R. 59 Bom. 57), the Indian Legislature by using the words \"professional or other misconduct\" in section 10 of the Indian Bar Councils Act intended to confer on the Court disciplinary jurisdiction to take action in all cases of misconduct whether in a professional or other capacity leaving it to the discretion of Court to take action only in suitable cases. To the like effect is the decision of a Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court in In the matter of an Advocate ([1936] I.L.R. 63 Cal. 867). The pleader concerned in the case of In re a Pleader (I.L.R. [1943] Mad. 459), was certainly not, by shouting slogans in Court, functioning as an Advocate, nevertheless he was dealt with under section 13(f) of the Legal Practitioners Act. Wallace's case (supra) was not a decision on any statutory provision such as we have in the Legal Practitioners Act or the Bar Councils Act. \n10. For the reasons stated above and in view of the conduct of the Advocate seen in the light of the surrounding circumstances we are clearly of opinion that the Advocate should, by reason of his having indulged in conduct unworthy of a member of the honourable profession to which he belongs, be suspended from practice for some time. He is an Advocate of this Court and according to a majority decision of this Court he is entitled, under the Supreme Court Advocates (Practice in High Courts) Act, to exercise his profession in all Courts throughout the Union of India. Any suspension for a period less than the period fixed by the Bombay High Court will obviously lead to serious anomaly and inconvenience. We accordingly direct that the Advocate concerned be suspended from practice for a period co-terminous with the period of suspension fixed by the Bombay High Court, namely, up to the 13th October, 1956. \n"}, {"id": "1776469", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Brajnandan Sinha vs Jyoti Narain on 8 November, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nBRAJNANDAN SINHA\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nJYOTI NARAIN.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n08/11/1955\n\nBENCH:\nBHAGWATI, NATWARLAL H.\nBENCH:\nBHAGWATI, NATWARLAL H.\nSINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.\nIMAM, SYED JAFFER\n\nCITATION:\n 1956 AIR   66\t\t  1955 SCR  (2) 955\n\n\nACT:\nPublic\tServants  (Inquiries) Act, 1850 (XXXVII\t of  1850)-A\nCommissioner appointed thereunder-Whether a court within the\nmeaning of Contempt of Courts Act, 1952 (XXXII of 1952).\n\n\n\nHEADNOTE:\nHeld,  that  a\tCommissioner  appointed\t under\tthe   Public\nServants  (Inquiries)  Act, 1850 (XXVII of 1850)  is  not  a\ncourt within the meaning of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952\n(XXXII of 1952).\nShell  Co. of Australia v.

This is an appeal with special leave by Pritam Singh, son of Surain Singh, hereinafter called Pritam Singh Fatehpuri, and Pritam Singh, son of Ladha Singh, hereinafter called Pritam Singh Lohara, against their conviction and the sentence of death passed upon them by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, and confirmed by the High Court of Punjab at Simla.\n2. Both the appellants were charged that they, along with Kartar Singh alias Mal and Gurdial Singh alias Karnail Singh absconding, on 2-5-1953, in furtherance of the common intention of them all committed the murders of Chanan Singh Orara and Sardul Singh by shooting them with firearms.\n3. The story unfolded in the evidence led by the prosecution was that, at about 6 p.m. on 2-5-1953, Pritam Singh Lohara and Kartar Singh got into Lorry No. P. N. A.--2404 at the bus stand at Amritsar. Chanan Singh Orara and his nephew Sardul Singh also travelled in this lorry.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri and Gurdial Singh got into the lorry on the way and seated themselves with Pritam Singh Lohara and Kartar Singh in the seats which had been already reserved for them by the latter. When the lorry neared the village Bohoru, the driver stopped the lorry on being asked to do so and the two Pritam Singhs and both the absconders got down from the lorry.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri and Gurdial Singh stood on the right flank of the lorry nearest to the seat on which Chanan Singh was sitting on the front-row of seats just behind the driver while Pritam Singh Lohara and Kartar Singh went over the left flank next to Sardul Singh. All the four whipped out small firearms.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri and Gurdial Singh fired at Chanan Singh while Pritam Singh Lohara and Kartar Singh fired at Sardul Singh with their respective firearms and both the victims died on the spot. Sardul Singh had a rifle, Ex. P-14 with him which was a licenced one and belonged to Chanan Singh Orara who had given it over to Sardul Singh for carrying it on the journey.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri caught hold of this rifle. Chanan Singh Orara had a licenced revolver Ex. P-56 hung round his neck and Pritam Singh Lohara removed this revolver. All the four culprits then ran away towards the canal side. They met four cyclists on the wav and relieved them of their cycles in order to hasten their retreat from the spot. The culprits subsequently abandoned these cycles at odd places and made themselves scarce.\n4. The driver of the lorry was Pritam Singh, son of Maqsudan Singh. He went to the police station Saddar Amritsar and made the report at 7-45 p.m. that day. Shri Om Prakash the S.H.O., reached the spot at 8-30 p.m. and entered upon the investigation of the offence and recorded the statements of various passengers in the lorry who were on the spot.\nAmongst the passengers so examined was a police constable, one Thakar Singh, who gave the clue to the identity of one of the culprits. 8 foot-prints were found in a field near the spot and the moulds of these foot-prints were taken on 3-5-1953. On the same day, moulds of 4 foot-prints in a field near the canal bank at some distance from the spot were also taken.\nThe identity of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri became known at about noon on 3-5-1953 and his house in Kaulsar in Amritsar City was raided at about 3-30 p.m. that day. Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was not there and his house was locked. The lock was broke open and a search of his house was made in the presence of witnesses. A bush-shirt, Ex. P-34, was found hanging on a peg in the house while a pair of shoes, Ex. P-29, were found laying on the floor. The bush-shirt was blood-stained.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri could not be found in spite of search at all likely places and proceedings under Sections 87/88, Criminal P. C. were taken against him. On 26-5-1953, Shri Om Prakash received information about the whereabouts of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and picketed a place on the Ganda Nala in the village area of Gumanapura on the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953.\nPritam Singh Fatehpuri was seen coming at about 3 p.m. from the side of village Gumanpura and was intercepted and caught. He had on him a rifle, Ex. P-14, slung round his shoulder. This rifle along with 15 cartridges in his dab were seized and a memo of recovery was made which was witnessed, amongst others, by Sohan Singh, P.W. 47 and Milka Singh, P.W. 46.\n5. An identification parade relating to Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was held in the District Jail at Amritsar on 29-5-1953 by Shri K.K. Puri, then Magistrate First Class, Amritsar. The accused refused to be identified by police constables Thakar Singh and Raj Pal Singh on the ground that Thakar Singh was his enemy and he had been shown to the witnesses already. Of the other witnesses, Gurdip Singh identified the accused as one of the culprits who murdered the two deceased while Dial Singh picked him out as one of the two men who had stopped the lorry at the railway crossing.    No   other witness  called at the parade could identify him correctly.\n6. Another identification parade relating to Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was held by Shri M. Isa Das, Magistrate First Class, Amritsar, on 6-6-1953 in the District Jail at Amritsar. None of the witnesses, however, could identify the accused in the parade.\n7. Pritam Singh Lohara was arrested on 9-6-1953 at Faridkot and was sent to the Faridkot Jail on the same day. He was interrogated there by Shri Om Prakash on 22-6-1953 and he disclosed that he had buried two revolvers wrapped in a bush-shirt and contained in a tin by the side of a bush in the vicinity of village Dipsinghwala.\nThis statement of his was reduced to writing and he then led the police party to a field in the village area of Dipsinghwala where he pointed out a place by the side of a bush and dug out therefrom a tin, Ex. P-57, which was found to contain the revolvers, Ex. P-48 and P-56, wrapped up in a bush-shirt.\nThe articles recovered were taken into possession. A separate case under the Arms Act was registered in Faridkot against him in respect of these recoveries. The learned Magistrate, First Class, Faridkot, convicted him under Section 19 (f), Arms Act. This conviction was, however, set aside by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, and he was acquitted of the charge leveled against him.\n8. On 17-6-1953, an identification parade was held in the District Jail at Faridkot relating to Pritam Singh Lohara. Before the identification parade started, the accused stated that he should not be made to walk during the identification proceedings. 16 witnesses were called, one by one, to pick out the accused from the row in which he and his 12 companions in the parade were made to sit. Out of these, 11 identified the accused correctly but the others failed to do so.\n9. On the same day another parade was held in the District Jail, Faridkot, for the identification of the foot-prints of Pritam Singh Lohara. The accused was made to walk with four other men, selected by the accused himself from the inmates of the jail, on a specially prepared sandy ground inside the jail.\nThe accused and his companions in the parade were made to walk with shoes on. Sohan Singh tracker and Sajjan Singh tracker were asked to identify the foot-prints of the accused and they identified the foot-prints of the accused correctly as the foot-prints of one of the four culprits which they had seen near the spot near village Bohoru.\n10. The bush-shirt, Ex. P-34, was sent to the Chemical Examiner and the Serologist, and, according to their reports, it was found stained with human blood.\n11. The prosecution led the evidence of some of the passengers who had travelled by the lorry in question. They also examined Pritam Singh, son of Maqsudan Singh, who was the driver of the lorry. They were all eye-witnesses of the occurrence. Out of these witnesses, Thakar Singh, P. W. 1 and Raj Pal P. W. 2, were police constables who were going to Jhabal in the same lorry in plain clothes.\nDial Singh, son of Chanan Singh Orara, also was examined and he deposed that Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Gurdial Singh had stopped his lorry in order to get in but had allowed the lorry to proceed further when they did not find their companions travelling in the same.\nPritam Singh, the driver of the lorry, turned hostile and had to be cross-examined by the prosecution. He had given the description of the culprits in the F.I.R. but did mot identify Pritam Singh Fatehpuri in the identification parade which was held in the District Jail at Amritsar on 29-5-1953. He also deposed that the witnesses who had identified Pritam Singh Lohara at Faridkot had gone to Faridkot two days before the identification parade and Shri Om Prakash had shown him in the Deorhi of the jail to the witnesses before the parade.\nIn view of this attitude of the witness the Court looked at the description given by him of the culprits in the F.I.R. and on a comparison of the description with the accused in the dock before it, it came to the conclusion that one of the descriptions fitted Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and thus was sufficient to identify him, observing:\n \"Anyhow, the description given in the First Information Report is by far more apt than inapt in its application to Pritam Singh Fatehpuri accused'.\nIn regard to the shoes, Ex. P-29 also, Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was asked in his examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C. whether the shoes belonged to him and what happened thereafter can best be described in the form of questions and answers therein recorded:--\n\"Q. Do the pair of shoes Ex. P-29 and the bush-shirt Ex. P-34 belong to you?\nA. No. I have never worn them.\nQ. Do the shoes Ex. P-29 fit your feet?\nA. I do not know.\nQ. Are you prepared to show whether they fit your feet?\nA. Yes. \"The accused has just put on the pair of shoes Ex. P-29 in Court. (The accused complains that the shoes are too tight for his feet, but to all appearance they quite fit his feet).\"\n12. As regards Pritam Singh Lohara also, the learned Additional Sessions Judge made him walk before him and observed that when he was made to walk he walked with a distinct limp although on previous occasions this limp was very much less marked and he was of the opinion that ordinarily the limp was slight.\nThe description of Pritam Singh Lohara as given in the F.I.R. was also considered enough apart from the evidence of other witnesses to fix the identity of this accused as being one of the murderers who took part in the murders of Chanan Singh Orara and Sardul Singh.\n13. Having regard to the evidence of eye-witnesses supported as it was by the evidence of identification, foot-prints, recoveries and the circumstances of both the Pritam Singhs having absconded after the occurrence, the learned Additional Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that the guilt of both the Pritam Singhs was established.\nThe three assessors who had aided in the trial were also unanimous in their opinion that both the accused were guilty of the murders and the learned Additional Sessions Judge accordingly convicted both of them of the offences with which they had been charged and sentenced them to death subject to confirmation by the High Court.\n14. The High Court scrutinised the whole of the evidence and considered the various criticisms which were leveled against it by the learned counsel for the accused. So far as Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was concerned, it marshalled the evidence and divided it into 6 categories:\n(1) Identification.\n(2) Recovery of a revolver from his safe kept in his house along with other things which he admits to belong to him.\n(3) Recovery of a rifle taken from Sardul Singh deceased.\n(4) Track evidence.\n(5) Finding of a bush-shirt; and\n \n\n(6) His absconding.\nThe identification evidence suffered from the disability that out of as many as 16 witnesses who were present at the identification parade held on 29-5-1953, barring the two constables who were refused by the accused, only two, viz., Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh identified the accused, and out of the 5 witnesses who were present at the identification parade held on 6-6-1953 none was able to identify him. Even so, the High Court considered that the identification by Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh was satisfactory and relied upon the same though it observed:\n\"If this was the only piece of evidence perhaps it would have been unsafe to convict as standing by itself it might not have been sufficient, but as I shall show later there are other pieces of evidence which go to support the case for the prosecution\". It further observed:\n\"In any case, I am satisfied that the identification was carried out in a very straightforward manner and identification by Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh cannot be rejected as being either casual or as a result of mere change\".\nThe recovery of the bush-shirt and the shoes from the house of the accused was also held proved by the evidence of the search witnesses and the bush-shirt Ex. P-34 with stains of human blood upon it was treated as a, further corroboration of the participation of the accused in the offence.\nThe rifle Ex. P-14 taken from Sardul Singh deceased was held to have been found upon the person of the accused when he was arrested on the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953 and the evidence of the search witnesses Milka Singh P. W. 46 and Sohan Singh P. W. 47 was accepted by the High Court even though they were criticised as stock witnesses who always were at the beck and call of the police and helped them in various raids and searches carried out by him.\nThe track evidence also was found sufficient to connect the accused with the crime inasmuch as the shoes found in his house were held to belong to him and the moulds of the foot-prints taken on the spot tallied with the impressions made by those shoes. Those shoes were moreover taken to have fitted the accused having regard to the observation made by the learned Additional Sessions Judge when examining the accused under Section 342, Criminal P. C. The case against Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was thus summed up by the High Court:\n\"Thus the evidence against Pritam Singh Fatehpuri which in my opinion has been established is:\n\"(1) Foot-prints were found at the spot which correspond to a pair of shoes which fits him and which was recovered from his house along with some other articles which he claims to be his although he gives a different explanation which I have not accepted;\n(2) A blood-stained shirt was found from his house;\n(3) He was found absconding and when arrested there was found on his the rifle which was being carried by Sardul Singh deceased, but there is no explanation as to how he came into possession of this article.\nThere is besides this the evidence of identification by one of the passengers of the bus in which he travelled and in which the deceased were travelling and of two constables whose names no doubt do not figure in the First Information Report but who state on oath that they were in the bus and by cross-examination it has not been shown that this statement of theirs is false. Besides this, the description which was given on the First Information Report of this accused does according to the learned trial Judge fit him. I would, therefore, hold that Pritam Singh Fatehpuri accused has been rightly convicted\".\n15. So far as Pritam Singh Lohara was concerned, the High Court grouped the evidence against him into 5 categories:\n(1) Eye-witnesses\n \n\n(2) Witnesses of identification\n \n\n(3) Foot-prints\n \n\n(4) Recovery of a revolver; and\n \n\n(5) Absconding.\nThe eye-witnesses including the police constables Thakar Singh and Raj Pal were believed by the High Court in spite of the criticisms leveled against them by the counsel for the accused. The identification evidence had been characterised as got up, the accused having alleged that, before the identification parade was held, he was shown by Shri Om Prakash to the witnesses in the Deorhi of Faridkot Jail.\nAs many as 11 witnesses out of the 16 who were present at the identification parade had identified the accused and it was alleged that most of them looked closely at the face of the accused for some time before they were able to identify him and obviously they were looking for some mark of identification on the face which had been communicated to them by Shri Om Prakash before they could identify him.\nAll these criticisms, were considered by the High Court and in spite of the same the High Court came to the conclusion that the identification evidence was satisfactory and could be relied upon. The track evidence was also relied upon by the High Court having regard to the fact that the shoes which had been supplied to the accused in the District Jail when the accused was made to walk there on a sandy patch specially prepared for the purpose created impressions which tallied with the moulds of the. foot-prints prepared on the spot.\nThe limp in the gait of the accused had created impressions which were particularly characteristic of this accused and the High Court was of the opinion that the tracks which were picked up on the spot were the tracks of Pritam Singh Lohara and that went to corroborate the story of the prosecution as to the complicity of the accused in the murders.\nIn regard to the recovery of Ex. P-14 the learned Additional Sessions Judge had not put any reliance on the acquittal of the accused by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, of the offence under the Arms Act, observing that any expression of opinion contained in the judgment was not only not binding on him but was irrelevant under the Indian Evidence Act.\nOn a perusal of the evidence led by the prosecution in this behalf he had held that the recovery of Ex. P-14 was proved against the accused and considered that as connecting Pritam Singh Lohara with the incident. The High Court, on the other hand, relied upon the observations of Lord MacDermott at p. 479 in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor, Federal of Malaya, 1950 A.C. 458 (A):--\n\"The effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent Court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the adjudication.\nThe maxim 'res judicata pro veritate accipitur' is no less applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict and was precluded from taking any steps to challenge it at the second trial\".\nHaving regard, therefore, to the circumstances attendant upon the recovery of the revolver Ex. P-14 and the acquittal of the accused of the offence under Section 19(f), Arms Act, the High Court was of the opinion that this evidence could not be taken into consideration against him.\nThe High Court, however, held that the evidence against Pritam Singh Lohara consisting of that of the eye-witnesses who stated that they saw him getting into the bus and then committing the murders and running away from the spot, of identification of footprints and of absconding, which was quite satisfactory, was sufficient to convict him and it accordingly came to the conclusion that he also had been rightly convicted.\n16. The High Court accordingly dismissed the appeals of both Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Pritam Singh Lohara, did not see any ground for interfering with the sentence of death passed upon them and confirmed the same.\n17. Both Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Pritam Singh Lohara applied for and obtained special leave to appeal from this Court and hence this appeal.\n18. Shri J.G. Sethi, learned counsel for the appellants, attacked in the first instance, the recoveries of the revolver Ex. P-56 and the rifle Ex. P-14 and submitted that neither of these recoveries could be relied upon as corroborative evidence against the respective accused.\nExhibit P-56 was recovered pursuant to the information given by Pritam Singh Lohara and was alleged to have been dug out of a field in the vicinity of the village Dipsinghwala. This revolver Ex. P-56 was alleged to have been taken from the person of Sardul Singh by Pritam Singh Lohara after Sardul Singh had been shot in the motor lorry.\nThe witnesses to the recovery were Shri Om Prakash, the investigating officer, Bakshish Singh and Shamsher Singh, who along with others, Joginder Singh, Gurcharan Singh and Dara Singh had been examined in the trial of Pritam Singh Lohara for the offence under the Arms Act.\nThough the Magistrate, First Class, Faridkot, convicted him in the first instance, the Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, in appeal, discussed the evidence of various witnesses and, giving him the benefit of doubt, acquitted him, remarking that the surfeit of defence evidence taken in conjunction with all the circumstances set out in the judgment raised strong doubts in his mind as to whether Pritam Singh Lohara was at all taken out of the police lock-up and taken to the alleged place of recovery and that the whole case appeared to have been conceived in a shadowy setting redolent with mystery.\nWhen the prosecution led the evidence in the present case they had cited Joginder Singh, Gurcharan Singh and Dara Singh but all of them were given up for one reason or other and the only persons examined were Shri Om Prakash and the two witnesses of recovery Bakshish Singh and Shamsher Singh. Shri Om Prakash was characterised as an unreliable witness and it was pointed out that the circumstance of his having paid Rs. 40 to the driver of the jeep out of his own money and not charging the same to the Government was suggestive of, the fact that he did not go to the spot where the recovery of Ex. P-56 was alleged to have been made nor did he take Pritam Singh Lohara there.\nReliance was placed on an article appearing in the issue of The Tribune dated 11-5-1953, Ex. D-A, which stated that Chanan Singh Orara's murder had been traced, that the arrest of Dara, a notorious smuggler by the local police had led to the recovery of three pistols hanging on the wall of a village well in Lopoki police station, that one of the pistols had been identified as having been worn by Jathedar Chanan Singh who, along with his nephew Sardul Singh, was shot dead in a bus on 2-5-1953 and that the police had also recovered from Chogawan a rifle which was carried by Sardul Singh.\nIt was urged that if this news item was correct Ex. P-56 could not have been recovered from the field near the village Dipsinghwala as alleged and must have been foisted on Pritam Singh Lohara by the police in order to provide a circumstantial piece of evidence against him.\nThe observations of the High Court, in appeal, were also relied upon to show that this circumstance could not be used against Pritam Singh Lohara having regard to the position in law as set out in the passage from the judgment of Lord MacDermott cited above and if that circumstance was of no avail to the prosecution as against Pritam Singh Lohara, the recovery of the rifle Ex. P-14 was similarly of no consequence there having been a joint trial of both the accused and Ex. P-14 having been one of the pistols alleged to have been recovered from the wall of the village well in Lopoki police station after the arrest of Dara.\nMilka Singh and Sohan Singh who were the two witnesses of the recovery of Ex. P-14 from the person of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri when he was arrested on the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953 were also characterised as the henchmen of the police who were readily available to them for all the searches and raids which they carried out in the locality. Milka Singh had been shown to have taken part in 4 searches and Sohan Singh was shown to have taken part in as many as 7 raids and searches all within one year and were therefore stock witnesses whose evidence could not be relied upon at all.\nThe manner in which the High Court brushed aside the criticisms against these witnesses was, it was urged, very unsatisfactory as the High Court did not take into account the fact that both these witnesses had taken part in raids and searches conducted by the police on numerous occasions and the absence of any pecuniary gratification to these witnesses which the High Court considered sufficient to rehabilitate their evidence could not be a true test of their veracity.\nWe were invited by the learned counsel to take an over-all picture of the circumstances attendant upon both these searches and to come to the conclusion that neither the recovery of Ex. P-56 nor the recovery of Ex. P-14 was satisfactorily established and these pieces of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the prosecution against both the accused were of no value at all.\n19. Whatever be the position in regard to the recovery of Ex. P-56 and the admissibility of evidence in regard to the same as against Pritam Singh Lohara in the present case, the position in regard to the recovery of the rifle Ex. P-14 from the person of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri when he was arrested as aforesaid, stood on a different footing.\nNo reliance could be placed on the article in the issue of The Tribune dated 11-5-1953 and beyond the fact that such an article did appear in that issue, nothing was established to show that 3 pistols including the revolver Ex. P-56 and the rifle Ex. P-14 had been recovered from a wall of the village well in Lopoki police station. The only manner in which the contents of that article could be utilised by the defence was that somebody whose identity was not traced had, in his capacity as the correspondent of The Tribune, published a news-item containing that information and that publication would put the Court on an enquiry into .the circumstances of the alleged recoveries and that the Court would scrutinise with great care the evidence led by the prosecution in regard to-the same.\nThe evidence of Shri Om Prakash certainly could not be viewed with suspicion  merely because the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, had acquitted the accused Pritam Singh Lohara of the charge under the Arms Act and the evidence of the  other witnesses also could not suffer in con  sequence of such acquittal. \nThe evidence of these witnesses, Bakshish Singh and Shamsher Singh in regard to the recovery of Ex. P-56 and of Milka Singh and Sohan Singh in regard to the recovery of Ex. P-14 would have to be considered independently and the latter could be considered against the accused only if the Court was satisfied that it was reliable. The evidence of Milka Singh and Sohan Singh was-scrutinised both by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and also by the High Court and both these Courts came to the conclusion that they could rely upon the same in spite of the criticisms which had been leveled against it by the counsel for the defence.\nThe reasons given by the High Court for rejecting the criticisms against their evidence were no doubt not as satisfactory as they should have been but the fact remains that both these witnesses were believed by the trial Court as also by the High Court and we, exercising our jurisdiction in special leave appeal, are not prepared to differ from that appreciation of the evidence by the Courts below.\nWe are of the opinion that the evidence of Milk a Singh and Sohan Singh establishes the fact of the recovery of Ex. P-14 from the person of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri when he was arrested on the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953 as aforesaid and this recovery of Ex. P-14 affords a cogent piece of circumstantial evidence against Pritam Singh Fatehpuri.\n20. As regards Pritam Singh Lohara, the recovery of Ex. P-56 though supported by the evidence of search witnesses Bakshish Singh and Shamsher Singh amongst others, was not considered enough by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, in appeal, to establish his guilt in regard to the offence under the Arms Act.\nSeveral defence witnesses had been examined by Pritam Singh Lohara in the trial Court including Dara Singh, the notorious smuggler described in the article in The Tribune dated 11-5-1953 above referred to. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, was impressed by that evidence, characterised the evidence of Shri Om Prakash and another police officer as evidence of over-zealous officials and came to the conclusion, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that there was considerable doubt in his mind as regards the guilt of Pritam Singh Lohara and acquitted him.\nThe acquittal of Pritam Singh Lqhara of that charge was tantamount to a finding that the prosecution had failed to establish the possession of the revolver Ex. P-56 by him. The possession of that revolver was a fact in issue which had to be established by the prosecution before he could be convicted of the offence with which he had been charged.\nThat fact was found against the prosecution and having regard to the observations of Lord MacDermott quoted above, could not be proved against Pritam Singh Lohara in any further proceedings between the Crown and him. We are of the opinion that the High Court was right in rejecting the evidence regarding the recovery of Ex. P-56 against Pritam Singh Lohara and the evidence against him would have to be considered regardless of the alleged recovery of Ex. P-56 at his instance.\n21. Learned conusel for the appellants next criticised the identification evidence against both the accused. As regards Pritam Singh Fatehpuri, two identification parades were held, one on 29-5-1953 and the other on 6-6-1953. At the first identification parade, out of 16 Witnesses who were present, the two constables Thakar Singh and Raj Pal were refused by the accused, and, from amongst the rest, only two witnesses, viz., Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh succeeded in identifying him.\nIt was urged that 17 witnesses failed to identify the accused from amongst whom 5 identified Jagir Singh, a wrong person altogether with the result that about 95 per cent of the witnesses failed to identify him. If the margin of error was thus taken into account, the evidence of Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh alone could not be considered sufficient to identify the accused, particularly when Pritam Singh, the driver, who was expected to have observed the accused at the time of the incident, had given an unsatisfactory description in the F.I.R. and had failed to identify him at the identification parade.\nWhile appreciating the strength of this criticism, we cannot, however, ignore the fact that both the Courts below relied upon the evidence of Gurdip Singh as sufficient to establish the identity of the accused and the evidence of Dial Singh also was similarly considered enough for that purpose. These are concurrent findings of fact reached by both the Courts below in regard to the identification of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri by both these witnesses, Gurdip Singh and Dial Singh, and we are of the opinion that he was satisfactorily identified by both of them and that piece of evidence is available to the prosecution against him.\n22. The identification of Pritam Singh Lohara was similary criticised as unsatisfactory. A charge was leveled against Shri Om Prakash that he had shown Pritam Singh Lohara to the identification witnesses in the Deorhi of Faridkot Jail two days before and that most of the witnesses who succeeded in identifying him at the parade closely scrutinized his face and looked about for some mark on his face before they could identify him. More important in this connection was the limp in the gait of Pritam Singh Lohara.\nIt was urged that if Pritam Singh Lohara had that limp and one leg of his was shorter than the other it was curious that none of the witnesses who were present in the lorry at the time of the incident noticed it when he made himself scarce thereafter.\nWe are not impressed by this criticism. The limp was proved before the learned Additional Sessions Judge and in fact he made his own observation in regard to the same commenting that when Pritam Singh Lohara was made to walk in his presence the limp was particularly in evidence though on former occasions it had not been so noticeable.\nThough the limp was certainly there, it was not such as to necessarily attract the notice of the witnesses who were present in the lorry at the time of the incident and it is highly probable that, in the flurry, none of these witnesses noticed that one of the culprits had such a limp. Their attention must have been concentrated more on the events that happened in the lorry and the risk to their own persons rather than on the limp in the gait of one of the culprits who, immediately after the incident, ran away snatching the cycles of four persons whom they came across in the course of their flight.\nThe absence of any mention of this limp, therefore, by these witnesses as also by Pritam Singh, the driver, in the F.I.R. which he made to the police immediately thereafter is not of much consequence. Both the Courts were moreover satisfied as regards the result of the identification parade held in regard to Pritam Singh Lohara and found as a fact that he was identified as one of the culprits. The identification of both Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Pritam Singh Lohara, therefore, stands established and is a piece of circumstantial evidence which can be used against them.\n23. It was further urged that the track evidence was quite unsatisfactory and should not have been relied upon by the Courts below. The science of identification of footprints was in a very rudimentary stage and it was submitted that such evidence could not furnish a satisfactory clue to the identity of the culprits.\nThe shoes which were found in the  search at the house of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri  had not been established to belong to him  and in the absence of any satisfactory evidence as to their ownership, any comparison  of the impressions made by those shoes with  the moulds prepared from the foot-prints on  the spot could not establish the identity of  Pritam Singh Fatehpuri as one of the culprits. \nThere was, moreover, a further circumstance in regard to him which was very vehemently criticised by his learned counsel and it was that in his examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C. the learned Additional Sessions Judge asked him to wear those shoes in order to see whether they fitted him. When he wore the shoes in Court, he complained that they were too tight for him; nevertheless the Court remarked that to all appearances they quite fitted his feet.\nThis observation of the Court, it was urged, was not legitimate and could not be considered against him. It was, therefore, contended that the track evidence was enough to establish the identity of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri as one of the culprits involved in the affair. We are unable to accept this contention. The science of identification of foot-prints is no doubt a rudimentary science and not much reliance can be placed on the result of such identification. The track evidence, however, can be relied upon as a circumstance which, along with other circumstances, would point to the identity of the culprit though by itself it would not be enough to carry conviction in the minds of the Court.\nThe shoes had been recovered in the search of the house of the accused and the result of the search was proved by calling the search witnesses whose evidence Was believed by both the Courts with the result that these shoes, having been recovered from his house, the ownership of the shoes was prima facie established to be his even though the accused had alleged that he was not staying in the house but had rented the house for some acquaintance of his.\nThere was evidence to show that he and his wife were staying there right up to 10 A.M. on 9-6-1953 on which day the search was made and if this evidence was believed it would go to establish his ownership of the shoes. If he was the owner of these shoes it was quite legitimate to compare the impressions made by these shoes with the moulds prepared from the foot-prints on the spot.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, in order to derive further assurance attempted, in the examination of the accused under Section 342. Criminal P. C. to see if these shoes which had been recovered from the house of the accused fitted his feet. If the accused had refused to accede to this suggestion of the learned Additional Sessions Judge he would have been justified in doing so and there is no provision in law by which this demonstration could have been made.\nThe accused, however, agreed to do so and on the shoes being tried on his feet it appeared that they fitted his feet. Realising, however, that the result of this demonstration would be adverse to his defence he complained that the shoes were too tight for his feet.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, thought otherwise and recorded his impression accordingly. This type of evidence was very strongly criticised by the learned counsel for the appellants as real evidence which was not justified at all by the provisions of Section 539B, Criminal P. C. or otherwise and it was urged that it was a matter which prejudiced the defence of the accused.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge was certainly not entitled to allow his view or observation to take the place of evidence because such view or observation of his could not be tested by cross-examination and the accused would certainly not be in a position to furnish any explanation in regard to the same.\nThe whole thing appears to have been done with the consent of the accused and the only criticism which could be legitimately leveled was against the observation recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge that \"to all appearance they quite fitted the feet of the accused even though he complained that the shoes were too tight for his feet\".\nThis observation could not carry the matter any further for the prosecution and the only fact which could be relied, upon by the prosecution was that the shoes apparently fitted the feet of the accused and the learned Additional Sessions Judge and the assessors were entitled only to take into account the fact that the shoes apparently fitted the feet of the accused though he complained that they were too tight for his feet.\nThis was occular demonstration and the result of such occular demonstration could certainly be taken into account by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and the assessors and they were entitled to come to their own conclusions taking into account the further fact that the accused did complain at the time that the shoes were too tight for his feet.\nThe evidence of the trackers and also the fact that shoes were found in the house of the accused and the impressions made thereby tallied with the moulds prepared from the foot-prints on the spot were even otherwise enough to establish the identity of the foot-prints and point to Pritam Singh Fatehpuri as one of the culprits.\n24. The case of Pritam Singh Lohara in regard to the track evidence was no different. In spite of the fact that none of the witnesses of the occurrence nor Pritam Singh, the driver, had stated anywhere before that Pritam Singh Lohara had a limp in his gait, the result of the evidence of the trackers was sufficient to establish that one of the culprits made foot-prints which showed that his way of walking was outwards and he put his right-foot more outwards than the left.\nThis was quite characteristic of Pritam Singh Lohara by reason of the limp in his gait and this was further demonstrated by the impressions which he made when he walked in the District Jail with the shoes given to him there on the sandy patch which was specially prepared for the purpose.\nThis evidence in regard to Pritam Singh Lohara also was believed by both the Courts below as sufficient to establish his identity as one of the culprits and we are not prepared to differ from their appreciation of the evidence. The track evidence, therefore, was a circumstance which was available to the prosecution against Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and Pritam Singh Lohara.\n25. The evidence of the police constables Thakar Singh and Raj Pal was very severely criticised by the learned counsel for the appellants. Even though Thakar Singh belonged to the police force and Pritam Singh Fatehpuri once belonged to the same and was known to him before the date of the incident, his name was not given out by Thakar Singh when Pritam Singh, the driver, made the enquiries from the passengers on the spot with the result that in the F.I.R. Pritam Singh the driver, gave such description of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri as he could.\nThe identity of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri was established only later on a clue being furnished by Thakar Singh himself to Shri Om Prakash and even then he was able to give out his name in the first instance but the name was ascertained later. Both these police constables did not reveal their identity on the spot nor did they take charge of the investigations but waited until Shri Om Prakash took their statements when only they disclosed to him who they were.\nThese criticisms, though they go some way towards creating a doubt about the veracity of these witnesses, do not, in our opinion, destroy the same.\nBoth these witnesses were, after due consideration of the circumstances and the criticisms leveled against their evidence, believed by both the Courts below and it is not for us to re-weigh or to re-appreciate their evidence and come to a contrary conclusion. Hearing the appeal on special leave, we should not lightly interfere with the appreciation of the evidence by the Courts below and we do mot see anything in the circumstance of this case which would compel us to do so.\n26. The facial identification of both the accused by the learned Additional Sessions Judge on a comparison of the description in the F.I.R. and the accused appearing in the dock before him was also very severely criticised by the learned counsel for the appellants and it was urged that this also was on a par with the real evidence furnished by the demonstration of the fitting of the shoes on the feet of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri while he was being examined under Section 342, Criminal P. C.\nThe learned Additional Sessions Judge, it was said, was not entitled to make such a comparison and come to a conclusion in regard to the identity of the accused as the culprits involved in the affair. We have the same remarks to make in connection with this facial identification as we made in connection with the other incident. There is this difference, however, between the two circumstances.\nWhereas in the case of the fitting of the shoes the assessors were also witnesses to the demonstration and could have been possibly influenced by the fact of the apparent fitting of the shoes to the feet of the accused, in the case of this facial identification it was only personal to the learned Additional Sessions Judge himself who mentioned it only in his judgment while discussing the various circumstances against the accused.\nNonetheless it must be acknowledged that it was not quite legitimate for the learned Additional Sessions Judge to do so because it would be substituting his view and observations in the place of evidence which could be tested by cross-examination and in respect of which it would be open also to the accused to furnish an explanation if such an explanation was asked for in his examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C.\nIn the absence of such test having been applied and an explanation sought from the accused in regard to the same, we are of the opinion that it was not open to the learned Additional Sessions Judge to incorporate these observations of his in the judgment and base his conclusions on the same.\nWe are, however, of the opinion that even discarding these observations of the learned Additional Sessions Judge in regard to the facial identification of both the accused, there is abundant evidence on the record which would justify his conclusions against them.\n27. The absconding of both the accused after the incident and their having made themselves scarce right from 2-5-1953 up to the night between the 26th and 27th May 1953 in the case of Pritam Singh Fatehpuri and up to 9-6-1953 in the case of Pritam Singh Lohara is a further circumstance against them.\nNo satisfactory explanation was at all rendered by either of them in regard to their absence from their normal place of residence and, they were not available to the police in spite of all their efforts to trace them. This absconding of the accused, therefore, along with the other incriminating circumstances goes a great way to point to their culpability.\n28. Having devoted our anxious thoughts to all the arguments addressed to us by the learned counsel for the appellants, we have come to the conclusion that the High Court was quite correct in the summary of the evidence against each of them and in holding that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing the guilt of the accused in regard to the offences with which they had been charged.\n29. We, therefore, dismiss the appeal and confirm the conviction and the sentence of death passed upon each of the accused. The sentences will be carried out according to law.\n"}, {"id": "444871", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Eradu And Ors. vs State Of Hyderabad on 1 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

These are Appeals with special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Hyderabad confirming the convictions and the sentences of transportation for life imposed upon the appellants, accused 1 to 4, by  the  Court   of the Additional   Sessions Judge, Medak, in respect of an offence under Section 243, I. P. C. corresponding to Section 302, Indian Penal Code.\n2. The accused 1 to 4, along, with one Baldev Muthiah, were charged that they, on or about the 15th day of Isfandar 1359 F. (15th January 1950) at 10 o'clock in the night, abducted one Muneem Lachiah, Telanga, resident of Dognelli, who was at his house, and carried him outside the village where they did him to death, due to enmity, by hitting him with stick and spear and that they took away a silver kardoda and arm kada from his body and that they thereby committed offences punishable under Sections 243 and 330, I. P. C.\n3. The learned Sessions Judge convicted the accused 1 to 4 of the offence under Section 243, I. P. C. and sentenced them to transportation for life. The accused 2 was further convicted under Section 337, I. P. C. and sentenced to a term of two years rigorous imprisonment. The sentences of transportation for life were submitted to the High Court for confirmation in accordance with the relevant provision of law in Hyderabad.\nThe High Court of Hyderabad, in appeal, agreed with the conclusion reached by the learned Sessions Judge and confirmed the conviction of the accused 1 to 4 under Section 243, I. P. C. and the sentences of transportation for life awarded to them by the Court below.\nOne of the learned Judges of the High Court simply confirmed the sentence tinder Section 243, I. P. C. but another learned Judge held that the accused were guilty of the offences under Sections 243 and 330, Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code (possibly meaning thereby the A. P. C.) and sentenced each of the accused to undergo life imprisonment on the above charges ill-realising that, in the whole of the judgment with which he agreed, there was not a word to justify the conviction under Section 330, A. P. C.\nIn substance, the judgment of the High Court came to this that the accused were convicted of the offence under Section 243, A. P. C. and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment in respect of the same.\n4. There was no direct evidence of the accused having committed the offence. The whole case rested on circumstantial evidence and that evidence consisted of the testimony of three witnesses, the wife of the deceased P. W. 5, the young son of the deceased P. W. 6 and a neighbour P. W. 7, who deposed that, on the evening of the day in question, all the four accused had gone to the house of the deceased and accosted him, asking him to accompany them to the well of one Deshmukh.\nThere was evidence of ill-will between the deceased and the accused in that the accused were alleged to have abducted the deceased a month before the alleged murder and set him at liberty on payment of a ransom of Rs. 350/- and also that the accused had, only three days before, deprived the deceased of a goat belonging to him from, the possession of Kumari Sayiga P. W. 2 and slaughtered it and ate it away and there was consequently a quarrel arising out of the search of the house of accused 1 and 2 made at the instance of the deceased.\nLastly, there were recoveries of the silver kardoda at the instance of accused 2, a white turban and a stick from the house of accused 1 and another stick from the house of accused 3. The silver kardoda was alleged to have been removed from the person of the deceased and buried in a secluded spot which was pointed out by accused 2 and the white turban was alleged to have been stained with human blood.\nThese were the pieces of circumstantial evidence which, according to the learned Sessions Judge, pointed inevitably to the conclusion that accused 1 to 4 were responsible for his death. The learned Judges of the High Court also were of the opinion that there were no eye-witnesses but a strong motive for the murder and the fact of all the accused having abducted the deceased on the night before the dead-body of the deceased was found were proved and these circumstances led to the conclusion that the accused were the perpetrators of the crime.\n5. There is no doubt that the deceased was done to death in a brutal manner and after he was so done to death his dead-body was brought to the doddi or the backyard of his house and was hung there by means of a piece of rope tied round his neck. The theory of suicide was rightly discarded by the Courts below and it was evident on the inquest report as also on the doctor's evidence that the injuries inflicted on the person of the deceased were homicidal injuries. The only question, therefore, which remained to be considered by the Courts below was whether accused 1 to 4 were responsible for those injuries and the consequent death of the deceased.\n6. There is also no doubt that accused 1 to 4 had in fact approached the deceased on the evening of that day and accosted him asking him to accompany them to the well of Deshmukh. This fact was proved by the evidence of the witnesses P. W. 5, P. W. 6 and P. W. 7 all of whom were believed by both the Courts below.\n7. It could not, however, by itself be enough to connect accused 1 to 4 with the crime. There was no evidence at all of any further movements of accused 1 to 4 or one or more of them nor was there anything to connect them with the crime except the recoveries made at their instance as evidenced by the various panchnamas which were proved before the learned Sessions Judge.\nThese panchnamas were criticised by the learned counsel for the appellants as containing evidence which was clearly inadmissible inasmuch as they contained, statements alleged to have been made by accused 1, 2 and 3 in regard to their participation in the crime.\nDiscarding these pieces of inadmissible evidence, therefore, there were indications of accused 1, 2 and 3 having pointed out the several articles which were recovered at their instance, as stated in the respective panchnamas and they proved that the silver kardoda was recovered at the instance of accused 2, a white turban and the stick were recovered at the instance of accused 1 and another stick was recovered at the instance of accused 3.\nThe white turban, even though it was alleged to have been stained with human blood, was, however not sent for analysis to the chemical analyser and the allegation in regard to its having been stained with human blood stood unconfirmed by any such analysis. The sticks also which were recovered at the instance of accused 1 and 3 were not alleged to bear any stains of human blood and there was nothing to distinguish these sticks from any other sticks which might ordinarily be found at the place of such people.\nThe silver kardoda was an article in common use by the people in that locality and there was nothing to identify it with the silver kardoda alleged to have been worn by the deceased except the bare word of his wife P. W. 5. These recoveries, therefore, could not connect accused 1 to 4 with the crime.  The recovery of the silver kardoda could, at best, prove that accused 2 was in the know of the same after it had been removed from the person of the deceased by whosoever was responsible for doing the deceased to death.\nNo charge of murder could certainly be entertained against him by reason of such recovery. The stick and the white turban recovered at the instance of accused 1 could also not connect accused 1 with the crime, the stick being an ordinary stick which was not proved to be the weapon of offence and the white turban not having been sent for chemical analysis of the blood stains alleged to have been found upon the same. The stick recovered at the instance of accused 3 was similarly innocuous and none of these recoveries could be enough to fasten upon accused 1 to 3 responsibility for the crime.\n8. The motive which was alleged against accused 1 to 4 also was equally unhelpful to the prosecution. The previous incident of accused 1 to 4 having abducted the deceased and having set him at liberty on receiving a ransom of Rs. 350 could not show that accused 1 to 4 had any grudge against the deceased. If at all they had received the ransom of Rs. 350, they could not be said to bear any ill-will against the deceased by reason of having received that payment.\nThe later incident of the goat having been slaughtered and eaten away by accused 1 to 4 might have led to some sort of bitterness between the deceased and them but the animosity would be on the side of the deceased and not of the persons who had eaten the goat. The version, however, given by the wife of the deceased, P. W. 5, in regard to this incident having been responsible for the enticing away of the deceased was not such as to carry conviction with the Court.\nIn the inquest report which was made on 16-1-1950, the wife of the deceased had stated that accused 1 to 4 had called her husband to settle the account of the excise contract. In the evidence which she gave before the Sessions Court, she stated that on her enquiry from accused 1 to 4 why they were taking him away they replied that they had eaten the goat and they wanted to repay him for it.\nBoth these statements could not be reconciled with each other and whatever be the correct version it rested merely on the bare word of the witness herself and was not corroborated by either of the two witnesses P. W. 6 or P. W. 7. Under the circumstances, the motive could not be said to have been satisfactorily established by the prosecution and that circumstance was certainly of no avail.\n9. If, therefore, neither the motive nor the recoveries could be of any help to the prosecution, the only thing which remained was the circumstance of accused 1 to 4 having accosted the deceased on the evening of that day and taken him away to the well of Deshmukh without anything more to connect them with the crime.\nThe only offence which could be laid at their door on that fact being established could be one of abduction which would involve the infliction upon them of a punishment which would certainly not be fife imprisonment. As we are informed all the accused have been undergoing sentences of rigorous imprisonment for the last 5 years and more and that would be more than enough to atone for the offence of abduction, if at all they committed the same.\n10. The conviction for the offence under Section 243, A. P. C., however, could not be sustained on the evidence as it stands on the record. It is a fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that circumstantial evidence should point inevitably to the conclusion that it was the accused and the accused only who were the perpetrators of the offence and such evidence should be incompatible with the innocence of the accused.\nBoth the Courts below considered that the fact of accused 1 to 4 enticing away the deceased on that evening and the further fact of the deceased having been found hanging in the doddi or the backyard of his house were by themselves enough to lead inevitably to the conclusion that it was the accused and the accused only who were responsible for the crime.\nWe cannot agree with this conclusion reached by the Courts below. In our opinion, these circumstances, by themselves, are not enough without anything more to connect the accused with the crime and the accused are entitled to be acquitted of the offences with which they have been charged.\n11. In view of the fact that they have already undergone rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and more, we do not think it necessary to order any further investigation into any other offence accused 1 to 4 might be alleged to have committed in connection with the occurrence.\nIn the case of accused 2 also, we do not think it necessary to express any opinion as regards his conviction under Section 337, A. P. C. because he has already undergone rigorous imprisonment for two years which was imposed  upon  him by  the   learned   Sessions Judge in respect of the same.\n12. We accordingly allow the appeals, quash the convictions and the sentences imposed upon the appellants under Section 243,  A. P.

The appellant instituted a suit in\nthe  court  of the Subordinate Judge of\t Kakinada,  for\t the\nrecovery  of  the amount due on the mortgage,  dated  14-12-\n1911, and prayed for sale of the hypotheca.  The respondents\nwere  impleaded as defendants but did not appear.  The\tsuit\nwas  decreed ex parte, and in execution of the\tdecree,\t the\nproperties of the respondents, mortgaged to A on  19-7-1909,\nwere  brought to sale, and purchased by\t the  decree-holder.\nThe  respondents  then instituted the present  suit  in\t the\nDistrict Court of East Godavari which then bad\tjurisdiction\nover  the  properties in suit, for a  declaration  that\t the\ndecree\t obtained  by  the  appellant  was  fraudulent\t and\ninoperative  and could not affect their title.\t The  plaint\nwas later on amended and a prayer added that the  properties\nmight  be  partitioned and the respondents put\tin  separate\npossession  of their share.  The trial Judge  dismissed\t the\nsuit and the District Court in appeal affirmed his decision.\nBefore the High Court in second appeal it was contended\t for\nthe first time that the decree in question did not direct  a\nsale  of  the mortgaged properties but a sale of  the  mort-\ngagee's\t rights under the mortgage deed dated 19-7-1909\t and\nas such the sale of the properties was void.  The High Court\nhaving\tcalled for a finding from the District Court  as  to\nwhat was sold, it was\n939\nfound  by that Court that the decree bad really\t directed  a\nsale  of  the mortgagee's rights and not of  the  properties\nmortgaged  and that there was excessive execution.  It\twas,\nhowever,  of opinion that the point should have\t been  taken\nbefore\tthe  executing court and the suit in so\t far  as  it\nclaimed\t relief\t on  the basis of  excessive  execution\t was\nbarred under s. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The High\nCourt declined to entertain the objection that the suit\t was\nbarred\tunder s. 47 as it had not been taken in the  written\nstatement  and\twas  raised for the  first  time  in  second\nappeal, and decreed the respondent's suit.  It was contended\nfor   the  appellant  that  the\t High  Court   should\thave\nentertained  the  objection and held that the  suit  was  so\nbarred.\nHeld,  that the appellant should be permitted to  raise\t the\ncontention.   The point relating to excessive execution\t had\nnever been specifically raised except before the High  Court\nand  the allegations in the plaint were vague  and  obscure.\nIt  is\ta  pure question of law which  requires\t no  further\ninvestigation  of  facts and was understood and\t debated  as\nsuch by the parties before the District Court.\nThat  it  was  well settled that  the  question\t whether  an\nexecution  sale was in excess of the decree and,  therefore,\nnot  warranted by it could be raised as between the  parties\nonly  by an application under s. 47 of the Code\t before\t the\nexecuting court and not by a separate suit.\nJ.

This is another appeal which comes before this Court on \"leave\" granted by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad which does not fulfil the requirements of Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution. Only the other day this Court in the case of Baladin Lodhi v. State of Uttar Pradesh,  had occasion to draw the attention of that Court to the observations made in the reported case of Nar Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh .\nIt was observed by this Court that the grant of a certificate under Article 134(1)(c) is not a matter of course but that the power has to be exercised after considering what difficult questions of law or principle were involved in the case which should require the further consideration of this Court. If the case as decided by the High Court oh the face of it did not involve any such questions, then apparently there was no justification for the High Court to certify that the case is a fit one for appeal to this Court.\nIt was further observed that the word \"certifies\" in Sub-article (1) (c) is a strong word which requires the High Court to look closely into the case to see if any special considerations arise. If a case does not involve any question of law, then however difficult the question of fact may be, that would not justify the grant of a certificate under Article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution, because if the High Court has any doubt about the facts of a criminal case, the benefit of that doubt must go to the accused.\nIf, on the other hand, the High Court has no doubt about the guilt of the accused and confirms the order of conviction passed by the trial Court, ordinarily there could be no ground for entertaining an application for a certificate that the case was a fit one for a further appeal to this Court. Where the High Court has reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death or where it has withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any Court subordinate to it and has convicted an accused person and sentenced him to death, those cases would be covered by the provisions respectively of Article 134(1)(a) and 134(1)(b) of the Constitution.\nTherefore, ordinarily in a case which does not involve a substantial question of law or principle in an affirming judgment, the High Court would not be justified in granting a certificate under Sub-article (c) of Article 134(1) of the Constitution.\n2. As will presently appear, the present case does not at all involve any question of law, far less any such question of unusual difficulty or importance. The conviction by the Courts below is based entirely on circumstantial evidence.\nThe only question before the High Court was whether the circumstances disclosed in the evidence do or do not unmistakably point to the conclusion that the accused was the guilty person. If the High Court had any doubt about the guilt of the accused or had any difficulty in accepting the evidence, its clear duty was to acquit. If, on the other hand, the High Court found, as it did find in the case in hand, that the evidence pointing to the guilt of the accused was clear, cogent and reliable, it had to dismiss the appeal.\nNo further question of doubt or difficulty could arise thereafter. In our opinion, therefore, the High Court's order which is the last sentence in the judgment appealed from in these terms: \"Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been asked for and is allowed\" was erroneous. In the result, we must hold that the certificate, if it can be called one, granted by \"the High Court does not fulfil the requirements of Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution.\n3. But that conclusion does not necessarily mean the end of the appeal. We have to consider whether in the circumstances of this case this Court could have thought fit to grant special leave in terms of Article 136 (1) of the Constitution. We therefore proceed to examine the case from that point of view.\n4. The facts of this case are simple. The accused Sunder Singh, was one of the several police constables attached to the D.I.G. of Police, Central Range, U.P. He was functioning as his orderly peon and used to drive his car. He along with a number of police constables used to stay in the out-houses with six rooms, attached to the official quarters of the D.I.G. of Police. The appellant, Het' Ram (P.W. 1), Sadhu Ram (P.W. 6), and Ram Lal, constables used to live in some of the rooms of the out-houses.\nThe appellant and Ram Lal apparently were on friendly terms. The appellant used to go to the room occupied by Ram Lal and his wife. The other constables were not living with their families. The prosecution case is that on the night between the 2nd and 3rd February 1954 at about 10 P.M. the appellant and Ram Lal aforesaid together left the bungalow of the D.I.G. on a cycle. Ramlal pedalled on the carrier. They proceeded towards the La Martiniere Ground, which is adjacent to the West of the D.I.G.'s bungalow with pucca roads on the north and west.\nThere is a culvert on the pucca road running east to west on the north of the La Martiniere Ground. The appellant returned alone by about 1 A.M. the same night. The next morning one Jagat Narain, a constable of the Armed Guard, noticed the dead body of a constable lying behind the residence of Shri Hukum Singh, Minister, near the La Martiniere Ground. He informed the D.I.G. of Police. Het Ram (P. W. 1) and other inmates of the servants quarters went and saw the dead body which they identified to be that of Ramlal. It had multiple incised wounds. Het Ram lodged the first information report at 7-40 A.M. on 3-2-1954, at Hazratganj thana in the city of Lucknow.\nSub-Inspector Ishtiaq Ahmad (P. W. 16) arrived at the spot and started investigation. After holding the inquest and sending the dead body for post-mortem examination, he noticed blood marks on the shoes of the appellant who was with him during the investigation. He formally arrested him at about 3 P.M. and interrogated him. He took possession of his shoes in the presence of two rickshaw drivers whom he picked up on the road and prepared-the seizure list (Ex. P-8) of the shoes (Ex. VIII).\nThereafter accompanied by the appellant and the two witnesses aforesaid, he went to search the appellant's room which he found locked. The appellant opened the lock. Inside the room was a box which was also unlocked by the appellant with his key. From inside the box were recovered bloodstained khaki shirt and pants (Exs. IX and X). From there he was taken to the culvert aforesaid on the road on the north of the Ground at a distance of about 200 paces from the quarters.\nFrom underneath the culvert a karauli (Ex. P-XI) (which is a small sword) was recovered as pointed out by the accused. These articles, namely, the bloodstained shoes, shirt, pants and the karauli were sent for examination and the report was that they were stained with human blood. The post-mortem examination was held by the Civil Surgeon of Lucknow, Dr. C.P. Tandon, who found as many as 32 incised and stab wounds, including one small abrasion which may have been caused by a fall.\nThe most serious of those wounds were on the back of the neck and back of the head which were homicidal and caused by \"a sharp-edged sharp pointed weapon\". A number of ribs were cut and so were the pleura, the larynx, the right lung, the pericardium (membrane of the heart), the large vessels on the left side of the neck, aorta and pulmonary artery and oesophagus. The stomach contained about 10 ounces of semi-digested food.\nIn the opinion of the doctor, death was due to \"shock and haemorrhage from the extensive injuries\" which \"could be caused by the weapon Ex. XI shown to me\". In cross-examination the doctor (P. W. 7) stated that \"the wounds on the neck could also be caused by a sword. There was a very remote possibility of stab wound having been caused by a spear\".\n5. As pointed out by the Courts below, the deceased Ramlal was butchered to death in a brutal manner. From the medical evidence it is also clear that the murder took place a few hours after the deceased had taken his night meal some time during the night of 2nd-3rd February, 1954 as alleged by the prosecution and that the karauli (Ex. XI) most likely was the weapon used for causing the multiple stab and incised wounds found on the body of the deceased.\n6. At the trial the prosecution adduced no direct evidence implicating the appellant. The case therefore depended entirely on circumstantial evidence which consisted of the following facts:\n(1) that the deceased and the appellant were last seen going together on a cycle at about 10 P.M. on the night of the 2nd February, 1954 towards the La Martiniere Ground where the dead body was discovered the next morning;\n(2) that at about 1 A.M. on the 3rd February, 1954 the appellant came back alone;\n(3) that the  investigating Sub-Inspector seized the shoes worn by the appellant (Ex. VIII), which were found to be stained with human blood as reported by the Serologist;\n(4) that on the search of the room occupied by the appellant from the box which was unlocked by him were recovered bloodstained khaki shirt and bloodstained pants (Exs. IX & X) which were also reported by the Serologist to be stained with human blood; and\n \n\n(5) the recovery of the karauli as pointed out by the accused from underneath the culvert on the pucca road to the north of the La Martiniere Ground.\n7. All these incriminating circumstances have been brought out in the evidence of P. Ws. 1, 6, 10 and 15, members of the constabulary belonging to the personal staff of the D.I.G. of Police, Central Range, and the investigating Sub-Inspector (P. W. 16).\nThe Courts had therefore no doubt that the evidence consisting as it did of his fellow constables and armed guards who had no sort of enmity against the accused, was reliable. They also found that the accused had a motive for murdering the deceased person inasmuch as according to the evidence there was a liaison between him and the wife of the deceased.\nThe learned Judges of the High Court have also pointed out that the nature of the most serious injuries, namely, those on the back part of the neck were such as could have been caused by a person sitting behind when the cycle was being pedalled by the deceased. After those serious injuries had been caused to the deceased he could easily have been overpowered and done to death by the other multiple injuries actually found on the dead body.\nThe Courts below therefore agreed in convicting the appellant of the murder of the deceased and imposing upon him the extreme penalty of the law in the absence of any extenuating circumstances.\n8. In this Court the learned counsel for the appellant has argued in the first instance that the seizure of the bloodstained shoes by the Sub-Inspector (P. W. 16) was not free from doubt as the witnesses who are said to have witnessed the seizure, Md. Irshad (P. W. 12) and Abdul Habib (P. W. 14) were not \"respectable inhabitants, of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate\" as required by Section 103, Criminal P. C.\nOn the face of it, section 103 would not apply to the seizure of the shoes which were being worn by the accused at the time he was with the investigating police officer. The section applies when a search is to be made of a place. It does not apply to the search of a person. In this case the Sub-Inspector saw, the accused putting on the pair of shoes and he seized them. There is no question of search either of a place or of a person.\nHence it was not necessary strictly in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 of the Code that there should have been two independent search witnesses. But the Sub-Inspector out of abundant caution asked those two rickshaw wallahs to be present as they were the persons most easily available.\nThe Sub-Inspector in spite of his efforts could not get any person from the Minister's quarters to be present at the projected search and most of the occupants of the servants quarters of the D.I.G. of Police were police constables or members of the armed guard. The Sub-Inspector naturally thought that the search witnesses should be persons other than constables or members of the arm ed guard.\n9. In respect of the search of the room occupied by the appellant and the recovery of the bloodstained shirt and bloodstained pants aforesaid it was necessary to have at least two search witnesses as required by section 103. Assuming that the two rickshaw-wallahs who actually witnessed the search as found by the Courts below were not respectable inhabitants of the locality, that circumstance would not invalidate the search.\nIt would only affect the weight of the evidence in support of the search and the recovery. Hence at the highest the irregularity in the search and the recovery in so far as the terms of Section 103 had not been fully complied with would not affect the legality of the proceedings. It only affected the weight of evidence which is a matter for Courts of fact and this Court would not ordinarily go behind the findings of fact concurrently arrived at by the Courts below.\nIt was also contended that the malkhana register and the seizure list were not all written in the same ink, but some portions were in different ink and that therefore they were not above suspicion. But these are again matters for Courts of fact. The Courts below have not omitted to consider those special features of the case and have come to the conclusion that those were not circumstances which affected the veracity of the witnesses examined in support of the prosecution case.\n10. The learned counsel for the appellant also sought to attack the findings of the Courts below on the question of motive by pointing out that on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses themselves it appeared that there was intimate friendship between the deceased and the appellant previous to the date of the occurrence.\nThe Courts below have considered that aspect of the case. It has been pointed out that the accused may have had an eye on the handsome wife of the deceased and that he had already developed a liaison with her. It cannot be said that those circumstances were not sufficient motive for the dastardly crime.\nThat is again a matter for Courts of fact. The learned counsel for the appellant has failed to make out any illegality or serious irregularity in procedure which can be said to have occasioned a failure of justice. No reasons have been adduced for interference with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "957056", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Gurcharan Singh And Anr. vs State Of Punjab on 2 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

This is an appeal by special leave on behalf of two brothers, Gurcharan Singh and Jagir Singh, who have been convicted under Section 302, Penal Code and sentenced to transportation for life by the Second Additional Sessions Judge of Ferozepore. Their convictions and sentences have been upheld by a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court by its judgment dated 30-6-1954.\nThe petitioners had been placed on trial along with two others, named Harnek Singh and Munshi. All these four had Been convicted and sentenced, as stated above, by the learned Sessions Judge; but on appeal, the High Court gave Harnek Singh and Munshi the benefit of the doubt and acquitted them.\n2. The prosecution case, shortly stated, is that on 2-9-1953 the two petitioners along with the other two accused, who were acquitted as aforesaid by the High Court, left their village called Sanghu Dhawan, all armed with 'gandasas' and were seen proceeding towards Muktsar town, about three miles away.\nA short time after, Inder Singh accompanied by his son, Gurnam Singh (P. W. 2) and Mohinder Singh (P.W. 4), who also belong to the same village, left for Muktsar to purchase some chemical manure on a permit by the agriculture department. Inder Singh proceeded ahead and the other two were behind him at a short distance. As soon as Inder Singh reached a certain bridge on the way to Muktsar, about a mile from the village, the four accused, who were lying in ambush in a neighbouring 'bajra' field, came out of the field and attacked him.\nGurcharan Singh, the first appellant, opened the attack with a 'gandasa' blow on his head. He was followed by Jagir Singh, accused, who dealt some 'gandasa' blows on his leg. Inder Singh fell down and all the four accused were said to have attacked him with 'gandasas' causing as many as 27 injuries on his person. Inder Singh's two companions, Gurnam Singh and Mohinder Singh aforesaid, raised an alarm but were helpless spectators, who being unarmed, could not venture to come to his rescue.\nFurther it was stated by the prosecution witnesses aforesaid that while there was life still left in Inder Singh, accused Jagir Singh chopped off their victim's head from the body just above the lower jaw and wrapped the head along with the turban in the 'chaddar' of the deceased.\nRaman Singh and Hari Singh (P. Ws.), who were returning from Muktsar, claimed to have seen the last part of the prosecution case, namely, that the four accused were seen making away with the head wrapped in a piece of cloth. Gurnam Singh (P. W. 2) hastened to the police station and lodged the first information report at 5 P. M. the same afternoon, the place of occurrence being noted as a mile and a half towards the east of the police station.\nThe time of the occurrence is not specified except saying that it was in the afternoon. In the first information report all the four accused persons were named and said to have conspired to kill Inder Singh.   The prosecution version as laid in the first information report is substantially as stated above. As regards the motive of the crime, it is said in the first information report \"All the four culprits suspected my father of his having given a secret information against them\".\n3. At the trial Gurnam Singh (P. W. 2) and Mohinder Singh (P. W. 4) deposed as eye-witnesses to the occurrence from beginning to end, whereas Raman Singh (P.W. 6) and Hari Singh (P. W. 7) deposed to the last part of the prosecution case as having witnessed the occurrence on hearing an alarm from about 100 to 150 yards. They claim to have seen all the four accused armed with 'gandasas' and Jagir Singh wrapping the head in a piece of cloth.\n4. The defence of the appellants was a denial of their participation in the occurrence and they explained their implication by alleging that they were on inimical terms with the family of the deceased Inder Singh. The appellant, Jagir Singh, set up a case of 'alibi' which may best be stated in his own words in his statement under Section 342, Criminal P. C. before the Magistrate who held the inquiry. He said:\n\"I am a member of Sanghu Dhawan panchayat. I along with other members of our panchayat came to Muktsar that day at 8 a.m. Chief Minister was here that day. I left Muktsar that day after the oath taking ceremony etc., at about 2-30 p.m. When I reached the local cinema it started raining.\nHead Constable Gurbux Singh and Sadhu Singh of Chak Bir Sarkar met me there. I remained there for about 1-1/2 hours and then went to village, when rain stopped. I was accompanied by Nar Singh, member village panchayat; Gitan Singh, Jalaur Singh & Jit Singh were coming to the thana to make the report. Nar Singh, member Panchayat enquired what the matter was. They replied that their father had been killed by an unknown person. Shortly afterwards, S. Bhag Singh, M.L.A. of Bir Sarkar met us. Then we went to the village. I am innocent\".\n5. It is convenient here to dispose of this particular defence of the accused to which our attention was invited by the learned counsel for the appellants. He urged that this was a very bold defence. It was taken at an early stage of the inquiry against the appellants and it could easily have been verified with reference to the official records.\nIt has been admitted in the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution that there was a function in the forenoon of the date of the occurrence at which the Chief Minister was present and the members of the Panchayat took their oath of office. According to the evidence, this function came to an end at about 12-30 p.m. The burden of proving the 'alibi' undoubtedly lay on the appellant Jagir Singh. It is true, as urged by his counsel, that this was a bold defence, but the burden to establish that defence, however bold it may have been, lay on the accused.\nNo attempt was made to call any evidence, oral or documentary, to prove that the appellant Jagir Singh was present at the ceremony and that it came to an end at about 2-30 p.m. as alleged by him. If that defence had been made out, certainly the appellant Jagir Singh would have been entitled to an acquittal because the occurrence could not have taken place much later than 2-30 p.m., though the exact time of the occurrence is not known.\nBut the indication in the evidence is that it took place at about 3 p.m. As the burden of proving this special defence of alibi has not been discharged, appellant Jagir Singh's case stands on the same footing as that of the other appellant.\n6. But even so, the burden of proving the case against the appellants was on the prosecution irrespective of whether or not the accused have made out a plausible defence. The case for the prosecution against the appellants rests on the testimony, as already indicated, of P. Ws. 2 and 4 who had accompanied the deceased from the village on the journey to Muktsar and P. Ws. 6 and 7 who were on their way back from Muktsar and were attracted to the scene of the occurrence by the alarm raised by those two witnesses.\nThe courts below have discussed the evidence of these four witnesses in great detail and have found it reliable notwithstanding the fact that Gurnam Singh (P. W. 2), Raman Singh (P. W. 6) and Hari Singh (P. W.7) are close relations of the deceased. On the face of it, therefore, there is no question of law involved and no grounds for interference have been made out in special appeal.\n7. But it has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants with his usual vehemence that the High Court did not act upon the testimony of those four witnesses in so far as it acquitted two of four accused, namely, Harnek Singh and Munshi. The reasons for the acquittal of those two persons may be stated in the words of the High Court as follows:--\n\"In regard to the complicity of Harnek Singh and Munshi, I have some doubt and I think that they must be given the benefit of the doubt. Neither Harnek Singh nor Munshi had any motive to murder Inder Singh. In the first information report definite part was assigned to Harnek Singh and Munshi inasmuch as it was said that Harnek Singh and Munshi inflicted gandasa blows from right side while Inder Singh was lying down and cut off major portion of his head from the body.\nGurnam Singh who made the first information report stated at the trial that it was not correct that Harnek Singh and Munshi accused had cut off the head of his father. Mohinder Singh, P. W. 4, gave evidence that Jagir Singh chopped off the head of Inder Singh.\nNo particular injuries are ascribed to Harnek Singh and Munshi. Raman Singh, P. W. 6, and Hari Singh, P. W. 7, deposed that they saw the four accused from a distance of 60 or 70 karams standing near the dead body of Inder Singh and that they had gandasas with them. Raman Singh stated that the four accused walked away towards Ude Karan. In my opinion, the evidence given by Raman Singh, P. W. 6, and Hari Singh, P. W. 7, does, not necessarily connect Harnek Singh and Munshi with the crime\".\n8. In this connection reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants on the recent decision of this Court dated 13-9-1955 (unreported) in the case of Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab (Since ). In that case two persons were placed on trial on a charge of murder and convicted by the trial court.\nOn appeal, the High Court acquitted one of them giving him the benefit of the doubt but maintained the conviction of the other, as also the sentence of death passed upon him. This Court found that the positive evidence against the convicted person was not stronger than or any different from the evidence led against the acquitted person. But that was not the sole ground of the decision.\nThis Court further observed that the direct testimony against the accused persons was not free from blemish, in so far as it appeared from the evidence that the first person who originated the theory of the complicity of the accused in that case was almost a blind: person who could not see things, particularly at the dead of the night, and that the other witnesses who turned up at the alarm had readily accepted the opinion of the first witness that it was the condemned person who had been responsible for the murderous assault.\nThis Court therefore felt a reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the oral testimony and had consequently to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused.\n9. The case in hand is similar to the case reported as Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab  in so far as it was found in that case, as we are inclined to hold in this case, that the acquittal of the other two accused by the High Court may not have been entirely correct.\nReference to that reported case is only by way of illustration and not by way of an appeal to precedent, because on the facts no two cases can be similar. Each case has its own peculiar facts and it is therefore always risky to appeal to precedents on questions of fact. The highest that can be or has Been said on behalf of the appellants in this case is that two of the four accused have been acquitted, though the evidence against them, so far as the direct testimony went, was the same as against the appellants also; but it does not follow as a necessary corollary that because the other two accused have been acquitted by the High Court the appellants also must be similarly acquitted.\nIn the present case the High Court differentiated the case of the two appellants from that of the other two accused whom it acquitted chiefly on the ground that whereas there was some evidence of motive against the two appellants, there was no such evidence against those two acquitted persons. On the question of motive the trial court held that it had not been established that the, deceased Inder Singh had given information to the police leading to the recovery of a pistol from Gurcharan Singh, the first appellant, and his conviction for an offence under the Arms Act.\nIt had only been established that Mohan Singh (P. W. 8), brother of the deceased Inder Singh, had given evidence against the accused in the Arms Act case. If that was the only case of animosity between the two families, the appellants could have greater reasons to be offended against Mohan Singh himself. But it has repeatedly been pointed out by this Court that where the positive evidence against the accused is clear, cogent and reliable, the question of motive is of no importance. As regards the question who gave which blows to the deceased, the prosecution evidence was that after Inder Singh fell from the blows of the two appellants, all the four accused gave gandasa blows to the fallen man.\nBe that as it may, we are no more concerned with the case against those two accused persons who have been acquitted by the High Court; but so far as the appellants are concerned, the evidence of the four eyewitnesses referred to above is consistent and has not been shaken in cross-examination. That evidence has been relied upon by the courts below and we do not see any sufficient reasons to go behind that finding. It is true that three out of those four witnesses are closely related to the deceased Inder Singh.\nBut that, it has again been repeatedly held, is no ground for not acting upon that testimony if it is otherwise reliable in the sense that the witnesses were competent witnesses who could be expected to be near about the place of occurrence and could have seen what happened that afternoon. We need not notice the other arguments sought to be advanced in this Court bearing upon the probabilities of the case because those are all questions of fact which have been adverted to and discussed by the courts below.\n10. In  our  opinion,  no grounds have been made out for interference.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.\n"}, {"id": "1178328", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Surjan And Ors. vs State Of Rajasthan on 1 November, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Rajasthan, whereby a number of accused who were acquitted by the Sessions Judge at the trial were convicted and sentenced on appeal by the High Court.\nIn addition, the High Court while confirming the conviction of another accused (Surjan) under Section 323, Penal Code convicted him also under Section 304, Penal Code and sentenced him therefore to ten years' rigorous imprisonment.\n2. The case arose out of an incident in the village of Dadoosan at or about 10 A.M. on 15-3-1949, between two rival groups. The village was a Jagir village belonging to a Jagirdar by name Thakore Bakhat Singh. The cultivating class in the village were mostly Bisnois and appear to have been split into two groups in connection with certain demands of the Jagirdar against the tenants, viz., the payment of hasal of Guar.\nTwenty families of Bisnois in the village were in favour of the payment to the Jagirdar and seven families against it. The accused are partly members of these seven families and partly residents of adjoining villages. The prosecution witnesses belong mostly to the group of the twenty families favourable to the Jagirdar.\n3. 15-3-1949 was the day next to the Holi called the Dulehandi day. On this day it was usual for the Bisnois to observe a ceremony called Pal at which all the Bisnois collect and take charanamrut from a Sad (who performs the Puja). In view of the existence of groups in the Bisnois of the village, the two groups had their Pal ceremony on that day separately.\nThe trouble arose with reference to the participation in this Pal ceremony of a person called Dhonkala examined as P.W. 4. He participated in the Pal ceremony celebrated by the twenty group. He appears to be somewhat closely related to some members of the seven group, who probably wanted to get him back to their group.\nIt is in the evidence of one of the prosecution witnesses, P.W. 18, that \"Peka (one of the accused belonging to the seven group) the brother of Dhonkala (P.W. 4) directed Dhonkala to join him and leave the twenty\". P.W. 4 himself says that he took Pal with the men of the twenty group and that when after taking Pal he started for home, Lachha (one of the accused belonging to the seven group) told him to take Pal with him and his party and that he did not go to them.\nWhether it was Peka or Lachha, it is clear that one of the members of the seven group wanted P.W. 4 to participate with them and that on his refusal some wordy abuse followed. According to the prosecution case this resulted in some of the accused pursuing P.W. 4 with a view to beat him. P.W. 4 ran into his dhani (hut).\nTwo of the accused Ramchand and Peka thereupon set fire to the dhani with a match stick. The flames which resulted from the fire attracted the attention of the others in the village and the prosecution eye-witnesses came running up to the scene. Some out of them attempted to extinguish the fire but the accused prevented them from doing so.\nOne Abhey Singh, a distant relation of the Jagirdar, was one of the prominent persons who so intervened. His interference was resented and three out of these accused were said to have hit him on the head with lathis which they had in their hands. It may be mentioned that it is part of the prosecution case that all the accused except one Ramchand came to the Pal with lathis in their hands and that accused Ramchand had an axe in his hands.\nThe assault on Abhey Singh by three of the accused resulted in a marpeet in which a number of persons on the prosecution side, viz. Rama, P.W. 13, Sawai, P.W. 14, Ridmal, P.W. 15, Chaina, P.W. 16 and Pusia, P.W. 18, also received injuries. The accused thereupon dispersed and went away to their places. Devi Singh, P.W. 8, the son of the Jagirdar, who is alleged to have run up to the scene of occurrence on noticing the smoke rising from the dhani of Dhonkala and who figured as an eye-witness of the incident in the case, took the injured persons to the Sanchore dispensary.\nAbhey Singh's injuries proved fatal and he died on the way to the hospital. A postmortem examination was held by the Doctor, P.W. 10. He also examined the injuries received by the others. P.W. 14, Sawai, received a large number of injuries numbering as many as thirteen. P.W. 13, Rama, received one injury. P.W. 15, Ridmal, received three injuries, P.W. 16, Chaina, received three injuries. P.W. 18, Pusia, received two injuries.\nAll the injuries of these five persons were simple consisting of contusions, abrasions, swellings and so forth, excepting one injury on Sawai, P.W. 14, which was a \"simple fracture at the junction of the upper one-fourth with the lower three-fourth of the left radius\". All the injuries, according to the Doctor, were received by blunt weapons excepting one incised wound on Pusia, P.W. 18, which according to the Doctor, was inflicted with a sharp weapon.\nIn the prosecution evidence this injury was ascribed to the accused Ramchand, who is said to have had an axe in his hand. The first information of this incident was lodged with the Circle Inspector of Police, Sanchore, on 15-3-1949, by Devi Singh, P.W. 8. Challan was presented against seventeen persons who, after preliminary enquiry, were committed to the Court of Session by the First Class Magistrate, Bhinmal, by his order dated 24-12-1949. The accused were charged thereby as follows.\nAll the accused were charged under Section 148, Penal Code, the common object of the assembly being said to be to set the dhani of Dhonkala on fire. Accused Surjan was separately charged under Section 302, Penal Code for causing the death of Abhey Singh. Accused Ramchand and Peka were charged under Section 436, Penal Code for setting fire to the dhani of Dhonkala, P.W. 4, Accused Ramchand was also separately charged under Section 324, Penal Code in view of his alleged assault with an axe in his hand.\nIn addition to these, all the accused were charged under Section 302, Penal Code taken with 149, Penal Code, Section 325, Penal Code taken with 149, Penal Code & Section 436, Penal Code taken with 149, Penal Code. At the Sessions trial, in addition to the above charges, individual charges were added against eight of the accused under Section 323, Penal Code.\nAfter trial, the learned Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that no unlawful assembly with a common object as alleged was made out. He was not satisfied that Ramchand and Peka set fire to the dhani of Dhonkala or that Surjan dealt the fatal blow on Abhey Singh.\nAccordingly he acquitted Ramchand, Peka and Surjan in respect of the respective individual charges framed against them. In view of his finding that unlawful assembly was not made out, he acquitted all the accused of the various charges against them under Sections 302/149, 325/149 and 436/149, Penal Code. The view taken by him was that the several accused could be found guilty only in respect of the individual part played by each.\nDealing with the evidence on this footing, he did not feel satisfied about the evidence against any of the accused excepting four. They were Surjan, Bhagchand son of Hamira, and Dhonkala (a person different from Dhonkala P.W. 4), who were said to have been the assailants of the deceased Abhey Singh, and Kana son of Hanuta who is said to have assaulted Sawai, P.W. 14. He accordingly convicted Surjan, Bhagchand and Dhonkala under Section 323, Penal Code and Kana under Section 325; Penal Code and sentenced each of them to undergo one year's rigorous imprisonment.\nThe remaining were acquitted. Thus thirteen persons were acquitted in toto while the four above mentioned were acquitted of all the major charges and were convicted only in respect of minor charges (Sections 823 and 325, Penal Code).\n4. Against this judgment the State filed an appeal disputing the correctness of the acquittals excepting as regards Rama. The four convicted persons also filed an appeal as regards the convictions and sentences against them.\nThe High Court dealt with these two appeals together. It was of the opinion that the judgment of the Sessions Judge was \"a very weak judgment\". Accordingly it considered the entire evidence for itself and confirmed two of the findings of the learned Sessions Judge, viz., (1) that no unlawful assembly was made out, and (2) that there was no adequate proof as to who set fire to the dhani of P.W. 4. But it was of the opinion that a case under Section 304, Penal Code was satisfactorily made out against accused Surjan in respect of the death of Abhey Singh.\nOn these findings the acquittal of the accused Ramchand and Peka in respect of Section 436, Penal Code, as also of Surjan in respect of Section 302, Penal Code as also the acquittal of all the accused with reference to the charges under Section 149, Penal Code were maintained. The High Court also proceeded on the view that the various accused could be held guilty, only in respect of the individual part played by them at the incident.\nAs regards accused Surjan it came to the conclusion that it was he who dealt the fatal blow on the head of Abhey Singh. He was accordingly held guilty under Section 304 Penal Code. As regards the various other accused it did not agree with the learned Sessions Judge that the individual participation was satisfactorily made out only as against three others, i.e., Bhagchand, Dhonkala and Kana. It held that the evidence of the individual part played by each of the accused was satisfactory in respect of a number of other accused also.\nIn the result the High Court affirmed the total acquittal in respect only of Ramchand and Peka but convicted the fourteen others. Surjan's conviction was altered to that under Section 304, Penal Code, with a sentence therefore of ten years' rigorous imprisonment. The convictions of the other thirteen were in respect of Section 323, Penal Code with a sentence therefore of one year R.I.\nThe appeal to this Court accordingly is by 14 of the original 17 accused, Ramchand and Peka going out by virtue of their total acquittal, and Rama having been left out by the State when filing its appeal to the High Court, for reasons which do not appear on the record. Out of the fourteen appellants who filed this appeal, the name of one person, Lachha, son of Arjun (who appears to have died during the pendency of the appeal in this Court) was struck off from the appeal by order of this Court, dated 13-12-1954.\n5. The main contention of the learned counsel for the appellant before us is that in reversing the acquittal, the learned Judges of the High Court have departed from the standards laid down by this Court in the cases in -- 'Surajpal Singh v. The State', , 'Ajmer Singh v. State of Punjab', , 'Puran v. State of Punjab', I, , 'Ittiravi Nambudiri v. State of Travancore-Cochin,' , 'Prandas v. State', , and 'Bansidhar Mohanty v. State of Orissa', .\nAll these cases lay down that while in such cases the High Court is free to appreciate the evidence for itself and to act on its own view thereof when it differs from that of the trial Court, it will not do so lightly and will be slow to reverse an acquittal except for strong and compelling reasons. These principles are now well-settled and are no longer in dispute.\nIn order to satisfy ourselves about the correctness or otherwise of the contention that the judgment of the High Court is not in consonance with the above standards, we have heard the matter at some length and given our careful consideration to it. We are satisfied that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge and the acquittals consequent thereon were such as called for interference on appeal by the State.\nThe learned Sessions Judge having come to the conclusion that no unlawful assembly was made out, proceeded to consider the question of the criminal liability of the individual accused with reference to the part played by each of them. But in considering the evidence for this purpose he set about this task in a somewhat curious way.\nOne should have thought that he would have taken up the cases of the individual accused one by one and seen who all speak against him and what part each witness ascribes to him, and that he would then have considered whether and how far the evidence of each of such eye-witnesses is reliable as against the particular accused. He has done nothing of the kind. He has set out in a very cursory way the evidence of only such of the prosecution eye-witnesses who have received injuries, i.e., P.Ws. 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18 and has proceeded on a somewhat artificial view that it is by the evidence only of these five witnesses in so far as each was able to speak to and identify his own assailants, that the individual accused could be found guilty.\nThe evidence of a number of other witnesses, which purports to show that the injuries which were in fact received by these prosecution witnesses were also inflicted by a large number of others has been completely ignored or brushed aside, Thus for instance Sawai, P.W. 14, as already stated, received 13 injuries. He himself spoke only to accused Kana, son of Hanuta having aimed a blow with a lathi on his left fore-arm breaking the arm-bone.\nOther witnesses have spoken to Sawai being assaulted by other accused.. Dhonkala, P.W. 4 speaks of Hanuta, Hema, P.W. 6 of Phagloo, Devi Singh, P.W. 8 of Lachha, Hanuta, also as being assailants of Sawai. But the evidence of none of these witnesses with reference to the alleged assaults on Sawai was even referred to, apparently on the unsound and unreal assumption that it is only the victim that can speak about his own assailants.\nBut curiously enough the learned Sessions Judge does not even adhere to his own standard. He reverses the assumption when he dealt with the injuries of Ridmal, P.W. 15. Ridmal received lacerated wounds on the right and left parietal regions. He spoke to Phagloo and Surjan as his assailants. But the learned Sessions Judge does not convict them in respect of the said injuries on the ground that no other eye-witness named them . as the assailants of Ridmal.\nAgain the learned Sessions Judge in considering the evidence of Chaina, P.W. 16, (who received a contusion on the left parietal region and had a swelling with abrasion on the right forearm and another swelling on the left forearm) said that Chaina deposed that Baga had hit him, but that he confused himself about the other assailants by stating first that it was Ramchand, and then correcting himself that it was Lakha. He, therefore, came to the conclusion that it is difficult to say who was the assailant and did not convict even Baga about whom there was no confusion.\nThus it is seen that in acquitting the various accused other than the four convicted by him, the learned Sessions Judge adopted inconsistent and unsound standards without any real effort to assess the credibility of the evidence given by the various alleged eye-witnesses as against each of the accused.\n6. Learned counel for the appellant attempted to justify the acquittals on the ground that the incident was in the nature of a confused melee between two hostile\ngroups in which fairly large numbers participated as alleged in the F.I.R. and that it was not really possible for any individual witness to have noticed who was the assailant of each of the prosecution witnesses that received injuries.\nIn support of his argument, he relied on the evidence that both the groups had  met at the place for the normal and legitimate purpose of performing Pal and that therefore the case that all the accused went there with lathis in their hands must be false.\nIt is pointed out that the incident occurred after the prosecution group had finished taking the Pal and before the accused proceeded to take it and that the F.I.R. which was filed by one of the alleged eye-witnesses, P.W. 8, is absolutely silent as to the part played by each of the accused as against each of the injured persons, but rolled up the whole incident into a vague statement as follows :\n \"40 or 45 persons in all (including the 17 accused whose names were specified) attacked the dhani of Dhonkala son of Hamira and set fire to it and beat Abhey Singh, Sawai, Ridmal, Chaina, Rama, Pusia, from among those who went to extinguish the fire with lathies\".\nIt is suggested that this is all the more remarkable since according to his own evidence, P.W. 8, the first informant, was accompanied by a number of eye-witnesses when he went to file the F.I.R. and that therefore he was in a position to get the complete picture by then.\nIt is also pointed out that most of the eye-witnesses belong to the rival group of Bisnois and were the tenants of the Jagirdar, whose relation Abhey Singh, was the victim of the murder and that individual ill-will of some of the eye-witnesses against some of the accused has also been brought out in cross-examination. It is necessary, however, to notice that the acquittals by the Sessions Judge of the various accused were not based on any such ground.\nIn a case of this kind there may well be adequate answers for criticisms of the sort which the learned counsel for the appellant has put forward. The mere fact that the judgments do not deal with them is not sufficient to show that they were not considered.\nNeither the trial Court nor the appellate Court proceeded on the view that there\nwas a confused melee in which none of the assailants could be identified by any of the witnesses. Nor are the acquittals by the trial Court based on the view that all or any of the eye-witnesses were not present on the scene or had particular motives to implicate any of such accused falsely. Indeed the very defence of six of the accused, viz. Peka Panna, Dhonkala, Ramchand, Kachhaba, and Baga, admits the presence of seven of the prosecution witnesses at the incident, viz., of P.Ws. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 18, and imputes to them aggressive action against themselves which is admitted to be the subject-matter of a counter-case.\nThe defence of alibi set up by some of the accused was not accepted by the trial Court in respect of any one of them. In these circumstances and in view of the highly unsatisfactory appreciation of the oral evidence by the learned Sessions Judge as pointed above, it is not possible to say that there is no justification for the correctness of the various acquittals being closely scrutinised and examined by the appellate Court.\nIn such a situation the Court is not only entitled but bound to give effect to its own independent conclusion on the evidence, giving due weight to all the circumstances which have normally to be kept in view in cases of this kind. We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that there was ample justification for interference by the High Court with the acquittals which resulted from the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge.\n7. Learned counsel for the appellants next submitted that assuming that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge was not satisfactory, the judgment of the High Court reversing the acquittals was not what it should have been. He urged that the learned Judges have not judicially applied their mind to the appreciation of evidence but that all that was done was\" to look at and set out only the evidence in the examination-in-chief of each of the prosecution witnesses without noticing and taking into consideration the material brought out in cross-examination to discredit such evidence.\nIt is also pointed out that the individual guilt of each of the accused was determined by merely cataloguing how many eye-witnesses spoke against each of the accused. On a careful perusal of the judgment of the High Court we cannot help feeling that there is room for the above criticism. This is not, however, to say that the learned Judges did not in fact scrutinise and appreciate the evidence.\nBut they owed it to themselves, when reversing acquittals that their judgment should clearly set out and discuss the evidence of the eye-witnesses as against each of the accused succinctly and categorically, instead of merely cataloguing a summary of the evidence of each prosecution witness and an enumeration of all who spoke against each accused.\n8. On the other hand, the learned Advocate-General for Rajasthan appearing for the State put forward a strenuous argument that the finding of both the Courts that there was no unlawful assembly is erroneous. It is no doubt rather extraordinary that in a case of this kind which was admittedly the outcome of conflict between two hostile groups resulting in the death of one person and injuries on a number of others, the accused should be able to get away with a concurrent finding of both the Courts that there was no unlawful assembly.\nWe have accordingly heard his argument in this behalf and are not prepared to say that the argument is without force. But we cannot give effect to any such argument in view of the fact that both the Courts have concurrently acquitted all the accused in respect of the charge under Section 148, Penal Code and of the various charges under Section 149, Penal Code.\nThe State has not obtained any leave from this Court for appeal against these acquittals. The said acquittals must accordingly stand. The learned Advocate-General urged that he was challenging the finding as to the non-existence of an unlawful assembly not for the purpose of getting the acquittals under Sections 148 and 149, Penal Code set aside and not even for the purpose of asking for any higher sentences in respect of the various convictions as found by the High Court but only in order to maintain those convictions and sentences.\nEven so, we cannot accept the validity of such an argument in justification of maintaining the convictions and sentences. The validity and correctness of the convictions must depend on the other merits of the case. The accused are entitled to the benefit of the finding that there was no unlawful assembly under Section 148, Penal Code and no constructive, liability under Section 149, Penal Code.\n9. What remains, therefore, to be considered is whether there is sufficient evidence as against each of the accused who have been convicted for specific offences in respect of their individual acts. Now, apart from two specific matters which will be dealt with presently, the question as to the sufficiency of evidence is one ultimately for the first appellate Court.\nIt is true that in so far as the appellants other than the four accused convicted by the trial Court are concerned, it cannot be said that there are concurrent findings against them by both the Courts below. Therefore it is arguable that the normal rule which this Court adopts for its own guidance in dealing with appeals by special leave, viz., that of not allowing the evidence to be canvassed, to challenge the concurrent findings of fact, is not applicable to this case.\nAll the same this Court will not, save in very exceptional cases, convert itself into a regular Court of appeal on evidence, in dealing with matters arising by way of special leave. In a case where it finds that the appellate Court has not at all applied its judicial mind to the appreciation of the evidence and grave injustice has resulted therefrom this Court may remand the case to the first appellate Court for fresh consideration. Keeping this in view we have permitted the evidence to be canvassed before us in its broad outline without going into meticulous details.\nOn a careful consideration thereof we are satisfied that this is not a case in which we should either go into a detailed examination of the evidence ourselves or call upon the High Court to reassess the evidence. We are, therefore, not prepared to set aside any of the convictions on the ground of absence of reliable evidence against the individual appellants who have been convicted with reference to the part played by each of them. Only two further questions that have been raised before us remain.\n10. Out of 14 appellants before us there are individual charges only as against nine of them, eight under Section 323, Penal Code arid one against Surjan under Section 302, Penal Code. It is urged that the conviction of the other five against whom the only charges were under Section 149, Penal Code cannot be maintained in the absence of specific charges under Section 323, Penal Code.\nIn view, however, of Section 535, Criminal P. C. prejudice arising from the omission must be made out before the Court can interfere with the convictions. We do not find that there has been any such prejudice or grave injustice in respect of the cases relating to these five accused. We are, therefore, not prepared to interfere in their favour on this ground.\n11. Now so far as accused Surjan is concerned, the case stands on a different\" footing. The specific charge against him is under Section 302, Penal Code for having committed the murder of Abhey Singh. The evidence of all the eye-witnesses was that the three persons Surjan, Bhagchand and Dhonkala son of Samaratha inflicted injuries on the deceased.\nWhile all the eye-witnesses excepting Dhonkala, P. W. 4, ascribe the fatal head-injury to Surjan, P. W. 4, Dhonkala, ascribes it to Bhagchand. The learned trial Judge was therefore not prepared to accept the evidence in so far as it ascribed the specific and fatal blow to Surjan. He was of the view that the evidence did not enable him to say who dealt the fatal blow.\nHaving acquitted all the accused under, Section 149, Penal Code he was of the opinion that each of the three persons including Surjan could be convicted only under Section 323, Penal Code. On-appeal, however, the learned Judges of the High Court virtually ignored the evidence of P. W. 4. In view of the evidence, in this behalf, of all the other eyewitnesses, they were of the opinion that Surjan was the person who gave the fatal blow.\nBut they held that he was guilty not under Section 302, Penal Code but only under Section 304, Penal Code. Surjan was accordingly convicted under Section 304, Penal Code and sentenced to ten years' rigorous imprisonment. Now, it is brought to our notice that it is in the medical evidence that there was more than one blow on the head of the deceased. If so, it is urged that it may well be that the evidence of P. W. 4 is not inconsistent with that of the other witnesses, in so far as they relate to the assault on the head of the deceased.\nIt is submitted that both Bhagchand as well as Surjan may have assaulted the deceased Abhey Singh on the head and that the two assaults may have resulted in two injuries on the head. If this view is accepted it follows that it would be difficult to depend on the evidence to determine who gave the fatal blow. The medical evidence in this behalf has therefore to be considered. P. W. 10 who conducted the post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased Abhey Singh recorded the following injuries on the deceased in his report.\n\"The following anti-mortem injuries were noted:\n1. Lacerated wound 21/2\" x 1/2\" x bone deep on Lt. parietal region.\n2. Contusion 7\" x 3\" front of the Rt. arm.\n3. Contused wound 1/2\" x 1/4\" medical aspect of 1st. phalanx of Rt. middle finger.\n4. Contusion 13\" x 3\" Rt. half of the back.\n5. Contusion 6\" x 2\" on the Rt. shoulder and arm.\n6. Bleeding from nostrils at Lt. ear.\n7. Depression 6\" x 2\" on the Rt. and Lt. parietal region.\nHead: Depressed fracture 8\" x 1\" Rt. and Lt. parietal bones. Deposition of blood clots below the meninges and in the brain substance.   Brain substance decomposed.\n* * * * *\n \n\nCause of death-- Coma due to the compression of the brain as a result of the injury to the head.\"\nIn his evidence before the Court he adds an item by way of No. 8 to the injuries above indicated as follows :\n \"8. Depressed fracture 8\" x 1\" of right and left parietal bones. Deposition of blood dots' below the meninges and in the brain substance.\" \nBut this is merely the note in the post-mortem report given with a separate number. He says that this injury No. 8 was sufficient in the ordinary course to cause death. It is clear that injuries 7 and 8 are the same, injury 7 being the external aspect and injury 3 being the internal aspect.\nThe point to be noticed, however, is that the evidence indicates prima facie two injuries on the head. (1) Lacerated wound on left parietal region, and (2) depressed fracture of right and left parietal bones. This naturally gave rise to some doubt as to whether these two injuries could be caused by one blow or were the result of two blows. The Doctor, P. W. 10, was therefore asked about this in cross-examination. His answer was as follows :\n \"The injury on the head of the deceased could be by one blow and also by more than one blow.\" \nIn view of this dubious answer the Court put questions to him. His answer thereto was the  following:\n\"The two injuries on the head should be by two blows. They could not be caused by single blow. I have wrongly deposed above that they could also be by one blow.' If this evidence of the Doctor is to be accepted -- and there is no reason why it should not be -- it is clear that two blows must have been inflicted on head of the deceased Abhey Singh. The learned Judges of the High Court, however, have not specifically noticed these answers of the Doctor to the questions by Court. They have brushed it aside as appears from the following passage in their judgment:\n\"We find that Abhji had eight injuries. Of these, one was on the head on the left parietal region. Four others were ordinary injuries on various other parts of the body. Sixth injury was bleeding from nostrils and left ear. This is really no independent injury for the bleeding must be due to the injury on the head. The seventh was a depression on the right and left parietal regions. This also appears to us to be the effect of injury No. 1 which caused the lacerated wound. The eighth was an internal injury, namely the fracture of the right and left parietal bones. It is obvious therefore that Abhji got only one blow on the head, and the witnesses are practically unanimous that it was given by Surjan.\"\nIt may be that it is not impossible that injuries 1 and 8 may be caused by one blow. If is also possible that the inquest report, Ex. P-16, which notes only one injury on the head describing it as \"an injury inflicted by a lathi near the top of the head\" is indicative of only one single blow on the head.\nBut the statement in the inquest report is not evidence by itself and it certainly cannot be pitted against the evidence of the medical witness given in Court. There is absolutely no material on the record on which the definite and categorical evidence of the medical witness that there were in fact two injuries on the head and that they could not be caused by a single blow could be discredited or ignored.\nWith respect, the learned Judges of the High Court in stating that \"it was obvious Abhji got only one blow on the head\" were acting not on evidence but on conjecture. In the circumstances the guilt of the accused Surjan must be determined on the footing that there were two injuries on the head of the deceased and that they were caused by two blows.\nAs there is no evidence as to who dealt the fatal blow, appellant Surjan must get the benefit of that state of the evidence. There was, therefore, no sufficient reason for the High Court to interfere with the acquittal of the appellant Surjan in respect of the alleged murderous assault by him.\nThe conviction of accused Surjan, therefore, under Section 304, Penal Code and the sentence of ten years' R. I. therefore cannot be maintained. His conviction by the Sessions Judge for an offence under Section 323, Penal Code and the sentence of one year R. I. therefore as confirmed by the High Court is maintained.\n12. In the result the appeal is dismiss ed except as regards the 'appellant Surjan. So far as he is concerned his conviction under Section 304, Penal Code and the sentence following thereupon are set aside and his conviction under Section 323, Penal Code and the sentence of one year's rigorous imprisonment therefore are, maintained.\n"}, {"id": "1377961", "date": "11/1955", "tagline": "Corporation Of Calcutta vs Mulchand Agarwalla on 17 November, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nCORPORATION OF CALCUTTA\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nMULCHAND AGARWALLA.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n17/11/1955\n\nBENCH:\nAIYYAR, T.L.

Naimunnisa Bibi and her sister, Khadija-ul-Kubra Bibi, since deceased, for partition of their shares in the estate of their father, Sheik Ataullah, who died sometime in 1892. The defendants to the action were their brothers, Sheik Kifayatullah and Sheik Mohammad Baqar.\nThe plaintiffs alleged that after the death of their father, Sheik Ataullah, they and the defendants were living together as members of one family, that the first defendant was in management of the properties on behalf of all of them, that on 10-8-1933 the defendants executed a deed of waqf-alal-aulad for the benefit of their descendants, and that the said deed was a denial of their rights. They accordingly prayed for partition and delivery of 14/48th share in the estate of the deceased Sheik Ataullah, which they claimed as belonging to them, for an account of the management of the same by the first defendant from 1892 and for future mesne profits from 2-2-1934.\nThe defendants contested the suit on three grounds, viz., (1) that there was a family custom excluding the female heirs from sharing in the inheritance, (2) that in 1893 there was a family settlement under which the plaintiffs gave up their rights to share in the estate, and (3) that the claim of the plaintiffs was extinguished by adverse possession on the part of the defendants, arid that the suit was barred by limitation.\n2. The Additional Subordinate Judge of Jaunpur who heard the suit, held by his judgment dated 14-5-1936 that the alleged custom was not made out, that there was, in fact, no family settlement, and that even if it were true, it would not be binding on the plaintiffs as they were minors at the date of the alleged settlement, and that the suit was not barred by limitation, as they had been at all times in enjoyment of the income from the properties.\nHe, however, held that the plaintiffs were entitled to 34/168th share in the estate of Sheik Ataullah and not 14/48th share as claimed in the plaint, and granted a decree for partition and possession of that share, and for rendition of accounts by the first defendant from 1892. The claim for future mesne profits was, however, negatived.\n3. Against this judgment, the defendants preferred an appeal to the High Court of Allahabad contending that the suit was liable to be dismissed on all the three grounds put forward in the trial Court, and further that the decree for rendition of accounts from 1892 was bad. The plaintiffs preferred a cross-appeal claiming that they were entitled also to their share of the profits from the estate from the date of the institution of the suit until they were put in separate possession.\nBy their judgment dated 22-10-1943 the learned Judges of the High Court agreed with the Subordinate Judge that the defendants had failed to establish the family custom excluding female heirs from inheritance, that further the family settlement which was alleged to have been entered into in 1893 was not proved, and that on the facts no question of limitation arose.\nThey, however, set aside the decree in so far as it directed rendition of accounts by the first defendant from 1892, but awarded the plaintiffs a decree for future mesne profits from the date of the plaint to be ascertained in further proceedings under Order 20, Rule 12. They also held -- and that was accepted by both parties -- that the correct share to which the plaintiffs were entitled was 153/672 and not 34/168, as decreed by the Subordinate Judge. It is against this judgment that the present appeal by the defendants is directed.\n4. Before considering the appeal on the merits, we have to deal with an application filed by the appellants under Order 23, Rule 3 for passing a decree in terms of an alleged compromise. According to them, the matters in dispute in the appeal were compromised on 12-9-1947, and the compromise was embodied in a document which is Record No. 1 in the Supplemental Record.\nIt must be mentioned that during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court the second plaintiff died leaving behind three sons and two daughters, and they were brought on record on 24-3-1938. One of these daughters, Zaina Bi, had subsequently died leaving behind, her husband, a son and daughter as her heirs, and they were brought on record on 29-7-1943.\nThe first defendant, Sheik Kifayatullah, died, and his three sons and two daughters were brought on record as his legal representatives on 4-1-1943. These were the persons who were interested in the subject-matter of the decree, which was under appeal.\nNow, the document on which the appellants rely as being the compromise is signed by the second defendant, Sheik Mohammad Baqar, but the heirs of the deceased first defendant are not parties thereto. On the side of the plaintiffs, the document purports to bear the thumb-impression of the first plaintiff, and of three of the children of the deceased second plaintiff, Mohammad Ibrahim, one of the sons of the second plaintiff, and the son and the daughter of the deceased Zainab Bi are not eo nomine parties to it.\nMohamed Ibrahim, having subsequently died, his three sons have been brought on record as his legal representatives, and they do not admit the genuineness of this document, and further contend that even if true, it is ineffective as neither the heirs of the deceased first defendant nor some of the heirs of the deceased second plaintiff are parties thereto.\nThey contend that as the compromise relates to a partition decree, and as under the proposed compromise the plaintiffs are to take as one group, it was impossible to give effect to that compromise, unless all the parties to the decree consented, and that as some of them have admittedly not joined in the compromise, it could not be made a rule of court under Order 23, Rule 3.\n5. In our opinion, the application must fail on the short ground that the compromise is not proved. The appellants applied to the High Court to have the compromise recorded and transmitted to this Court. In their application, they stated that the sons of the first defendant, though agreeable to the terms of the compromise at one stage, changed their mind later on.\nEven with reference to the parties whose names appeared on the document, as the compromise was not admitted the High Court called for a report from the Civil Judge, Jaunpur as to the truth thereof. But none of the parties turned up at the hearing before the Civil Judge though the matter was before him twice, with the result that he sent a report that the compromise had not been verified.\nThis report was accepted by the learned Judges in their order dated 29-7-1949. On the materials before us, there is no proof that there was any compromise between the parties, and the petition under Order 23, Rule 3 to pass a decree in terms of compromise must accordingly be dismissed.\n6. On the merits, two contentions have been pressed before us: (1) that the family custom excluding the females from taking as heirs must be held to be established, and (2) that the claim of the plaintiffs is barred by limitation. The burden of proving a custom in derogation of the general law being heavily on the party who sets it up, it was incumbent on the appellants to prove by clear and cogent evidence that there was such a custom as was pleaded by them.\nIt is admitted that there is no documentary evidence in support of it. The appellants examined six witnesses in proof of it. The trial Judge was not impressed by their evidence, and has given good reasons for rejecting it. No serious attempt appears to have been made before the High Court to rehabilitate them.\nThe strongest piece of evidence relied on by the appellants is on entry in the mutation of records made in 1893, in which it is stated that the daughters are excluded by custom from sharing in the inheritance, and that therefore the names of the sons of Ata-ullah alone are entered as his heirs. It appears from this very record that the source of this information was the first defendant himself, who at that time is stated to have been about 22 years old.\nIt is obvious that a statement as to custom from a person of that age cannot command much weight, as that must largely depend on his means of knowledge. In view of the fact that he was himself a person interested, his statement must be discarded as too slender for supporting the custom. We do not find any sufficient grounds for disturbing the concurrent findings of the Courts below on this point, and the custom pleaded by the defendants must, therefore, be held not to have been established.\n7. Then, there is the question of limitation. The parties to the action are co-sharers, and as under the law, possession of one co-sharer is possession of all co-sharers it cannot be adverse to them, unless there is a denial of their right to their knowledge by the person in possession, and exclusion and ouster following thereon for the statutory period.\nThe facts found are that the plaintiffs were minors at the time of their father's death, that they continued to live with their brothers in the same house down to the year 1918, that thereafter they went to reside with their husbands but that they continued to draw from the family chest for all expenses.\nThe Courts below have found that as the plaintiffs were in enjoyment of the income from the estate, there was no ouster, and that is clearly right. It was not until 1933 when the defendants executed the waqf deed that there was any denial of the title of the plaintiffs, and down to that date, they had been in enjoyment of the properties.\nIt was argued that what the plaintiffs received was only maintenance, and could not be attributed to their right to a share in the properties. But the evidence shows that the receipts were not merely for maintenance, and that they were of the same character as the receipts by the defendants themselves from the estate during this period. Moreover, there can be no question of ouster, if there is participation in the profits to any degree. On the facts found, therefore, no question of adverse possession arises.\n8. Both the contentions urged in support of the appeal fail, and the appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.\n"}, {"id": "718964", "date": "12/1955", "tagline": "Aher Raja Khima vs The State Of Saurashtra on 22 December, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nAHER RAJA KHIMA\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE STATE OF SAURASHTRA.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n22/12/1955\n\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nAIYYAR, T.L.

Travancore Taxation on\nIncome\t(Investigation\tCommission) Act, 1124  (Act  XIV  of\n1124)  modelled on the Indian Act XXX of 1947 was passed  by\nthe Travancore Legislature, to provide for an  investigation\ninto matters relating to taxation on income.  In July 1949 ,\nthe  United State of Travancore and Cochin was brought\tinto\nexistence as a result of integration between the two States.\nAll existing laws of Travancore were to continue in force by\nvirtue of Ordinance I of 1124 which was later enacted as Act\nVI of 1125.  In November 1949 the Government of the  'United\nState of Travancore-\n1197\nCochin issued orders under s. 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV\nof 1 124 referring the cases of the petitioner for the years\n1942 and 1943 (called Evasion Cases Nos. 1 & 2 of 1125)\t for\ninvestigation  by  the Travancore  Income-Tax  Investigation\nCommission.

A\t preliminary\nobjection to the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain\nthe  writ petition was repeated in the Supreme Court by\t the\nAttorney-General.\nHeld, that the High Court bad jurisdiction under Art. 226 of\nthe  Constitution to issue a writ against Respondent  No.  1\nbecause\t under the provisions of s. 6 of the Travancore\t Act\nXIV  of 1124 the authorised official (Respondent No. 1)\t had\nconsiderable powers conferred upon him in the conduct of the\ninvestigation, and if he did anything as authorised official\nwhich  was  not authorised by law or was  violative  of\t the\nfundamental rights of the petitioner as in the present\tcase\nbe  would be amenable to the jurisdiction of the High  Court\nunder Art. 226 of the Constitution.\nHeld,  further that under the provisions of  the  Travancore\nAct  XIV  of  1124  the\t Commission  had  no  authority\t 'to\ninvestigate  any case suo motu.\t It could  only\t investigate\ncases referred to it by\n1198\nGovernment.  All that was done in the present case was\tthat\nby  two\t separate orders made under s. 5(1) of the  Act\t the\nGovernment referred two cases of the petitioner for the\t two\nyears  1942 and 1943 to the Commission.\t There was no  other\norder  under s. 5(1) at any time before 16th  February\t1950\nand  none  could be made under that sub-section\t after\tthat\ndate.  Therefore neither Respondent No. 2 nor Respondent No.\n1   who\t had  been  appointed  as  authorised  Official\t  by\nRespondent No. 2 had jurisdiction to cover any period beyond\nthe  two specific years 1942 and 1943 and the  notice  dated\n21st November 1951 issued by Respondent No. 1 to investigate\nthe petitioner's income for the period from 1940 to the last\ncompleted  assessment year was clearly illegal\tand  without\njurisdiction.\nHeld,  also that s. 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV  of\t1124\nwhich  is  to be read in juxta-position with s.\t 47  of\t the\nTravancore  Inc6me-Tax\tAct,  1121 (XXIII of  1121)  is\t not\ndiscriminatory\tand  violative\tof  the\t fundamental   right\nguaranteed under Art. 14 of the Constitution.\nSection\t 47(1)\tof  the Travancore Act\tXXIII  of  1121\t was\ndirected only against those persons concerning whom definite\ninformation  came  into the possession\tof  the,  Income-tax\nOfficer\t and in consequence of which the Income-tax  Officer\ndiscovered  that the income of those persons had escaped  or\nbeen  under-assessed  or assessed at too low a rate  or\t had\nbeen the subject of excessive relief.  The class of  persons\nenvisaged by s. 47(1) was a definite class about which there\nwas definite information leading to discovery within 8 years\nor  4 years as the case may be of definite item or items  of\nincome which had escaped assessment.  The action to be taken\nunder  Travancore  Act\tXXIII of 1121 was  not\tconfined  to\nescapement  from  assessment of income made during  the\t war\nperiod\t(September 1939 to 1946).  Action could be taken  in\nrespect\t of income which escaped assessment even before\t the\nwar and also more than 8 years after the end of the war.\nOn the other hand under s. 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of\n1124  the  class of persons sought to be  reached  comprised\nonly  these  persons  about  whom  there  was  no   definite\ninformation  and no discovery of any definite item or  items\nof  income  which  escaped  taxation  but  about  whom\t the\nGovernment had only prima facie reason to believe that\tthey\nhad evaded payment of tax to a substantial amount.  Further,\naction under s. 5(1) read with s. 8(2) of the Travancore Act\nXIV of 1124 was definitely limited to the evasion of payment\nof  taxation  on  income  made during  the  war\t period\t and\ntherefore s. 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 was\t not\ndiscriminatory in comparison with s. 47(1) of the Travancore\nAct XXIII of 1121.\nElection  Commission,  India  v.

The High Court held\t (i)\nthat  the  charges  set\t out in\t the  application  bad\tbeen\nsubstantially proved and that it was a fit case for an order\nfor  winding  up being made under s. 162(vi) and  (ii)\tthat\nunder the circumstances action could be taken under s. 153-C\nand accordingly it appointed two administrators with all the\npowers\tof  directors  to  look after  the  affairs  of\t the\nCompany.  On appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court by\nthe Company it was contended that the\n1067\napplication under s. 153-C was not maintainable inasmuch  as\nthere  was  no\tproof that the applicant  had  obtained\t the\nconsent\t of requisite number of shareholders as provided  in\nsub-clause (3)(a)(i) to s. 153-C, that clause providing that\na  member  applying for relief must obtain  the\t consent  in\nwriting of not less than one hundred members of the  Company\nor  not\t less than one-tenth of the members of\tthe  Company\nwhichever is less.  It was alleged that thirteen members who\nhad given their consent to the filing of the application had\nsubsequently withdrawn their consent.\nHeld  that the validity of a petition must be judged on\t the\nfacts  as they were at the time of its presentation,  and  a\npetition  which\t was  valid when presented  cannot,  in\t the\nabsence of a provision to that effect in the statute,  cease\nto  be\tmaintainable by reason of events subsequent  to\t its\npresentation.  The withdrawal of consent by thirteen of\t the\nmembers, even if true, could not affect either the right  of\nthe applicant to proceed with the application or the  juris-\ndiction of the court to dispose of it on its own merits.\nHeld  further that before taking action under s.  153-C\t the\ncourt must be satisfied that circumstances exist on which an\norder  for winding up could be made under s. 162  and  where\ntherefore  the\tfacts  proved do not make  out\ta  case\t for\nwinding\t up  under s. 162, no order can be passed  under  s.\n153-C.\nThe  words \"just and equitable\" in s. 162(vi) are not to  be\nconstrued  ejusdem  generis with the  matters  mentioned  in\nclauses (i) to (v)  of the section.\nIf  there  is  merely  a  misconduct  of  the  directors  in\nmisappropriating  the  funds  of the Company  an  order\t for\nwinding\t up  would  not\t be just and  equitable\t but  if  in\naddition  to  such  misconduct,\t circumstances\texist  which\nrender\tit  desirable in the interests of  the\tshareholders\nthat the Company should be wound up, s. 162(vi) would be  no\nbar to the jurisdiction of the court to make such an order.\nThe order for winding up was just and equitable in the\tcir-\ncumstances of the present case.\nIn re Anglo-Greek Steam Company ([1866] L.R. 2 Eq. 1), In re\nDiamond\t Fuel  Company ([1879] 13 Ch.

Though they are not courts in the strict  sense\nof the term, they have to discharge quasi judicial functions\nand  as such are subject to the overriding  jurisdiction  of\nthe Supreme Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution.  Their\npowers\tare derived from the statute that creates  them\t and\nthey have to function within the limits imposed there and to\nact  according to its provisions.  Those  provisions  invest\nthem with many of the trappings\" of a court and deprive them\nof arbitrary or absolute discretion and power.\nBenevolent   despotism\t is   foreign\tto   a\t  democratic\nConstitution.  When the Constitution of India converted this\ncountry\t into a sovereign, democratic, republic, it did\t not\ninvest it with the mere trappings of democracy but  invested\nit,  with  the real thing, the true kernel of which  is\t the\nultimate authority of the courts to restrain all exercise of\nabsolute  and arbitrary power not only by the executive\t and\nby   officials\tand  lesser  tribunals\tbut  also   by\t the\nlegislatures   and   even   by\t Parliament   itself.\t The\nConstitution  established a \"Rule of Law\" in this  land\t and\nthat  carries with it restraints and restrictions  that\t are\nforeign to despotic power.\nThe courts, however, must always exercise caution and should\nnot substitute their own judgment and discretion for that of\nsuch tribunals.\n166\n1316\n   In  view of ss. 7 and 11 of the Industrial Disputes\tAct,\n1947 and U.P.

The words  \"if  in\nconsequence of definite information which has come into\t his\npossession  the\t lncome-tax.Officer discovers  that  income,\nprofits\t or  gains  chargeable to  income-tax  have  escaped\nassessment in any year.............. which appear in the old\nsection\t were  substituted by the words \"if  the  Income-tax\nOfficer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission\nor  failure on the part of the assessee............  income,\nprofits\t or gains chargeable to income-tax have escaped\t The\nrequisites  of\t(i)\"definite\" information (ii) which  had  \"\ncome  into\"  possession\t of the Income-tax  Officer  and  in\nconsequence  of\t which\t(iii) he  \"discovers\"  that  income,\nprofits\t or  gains  chargeable\tto  income-tax\tbad  escaped\nassessment,  were  no longer necessary and  the\t only  thing\nwhich was required to enable the Income-tax Officer to\ttake\nproceedings  under  S. 34(1) as amended was that  he  should\nhave  reason  to believe that by reason of the\tomission  or\nfailure on the part of the assesses income, profits or gains\nchargeable  to\tincome-tax  had\t escaped  assessment  for  a\nparticular year.  Whereas before this amended s. 34(1)\tcame\nto  be\tsubstituted for the old s. 34(1) there was  no\tcom-\nparison between the provisions of s. 5(1) of Act XXX of 1947\nand s. 34(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act as it then  stood,\nthe  provisions\t of  s.\t 34(1)\tas  amended  after  the\t 8th\nSeptember 1948 could stand comparison with the provisions of\ns. 5(1) of Act XXX of 1947 and the cases which were  covered\nby s. 5(1) of Act XXX of 1947 could be dealt with under\t the\nprocedure  laid\t down in s. 34(1) of the  Indian  Income-tax\nAct.   After the 8th September 1948, therefore, even in\t the\ncase  of  substantial  evaders\tof  income-tax\twho  were  a\ndistinct  class by themselves intended to be treated by\t the\ndrastic and summary procedure laid down by Act XXX of  1947,\nsome  cases  that  were\t already  referred  by\tthe  Central\nGovernment  for\t investigation by the  Commission  could  be\ndealt  with under that Act and other cases,  though  falling\nwithin the same class or category, could be dealt with under\nthe  procedure\tprescribed in the amended s.  34(1)  of\t the\nIndian Income-tax Act.\tThe persons who were thus dealt with\nunder s. 34(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act had available to\nthem the whole procedure laid down in that Act including the\nright  to  inspect documents and the right to  question\t the\nfindings of fact arrived at\n1249\nby  the\t Income-tax Officer by the procedure of\t appeal\t and\nrevision  and ultimate scrutiny by the Income-tax  Appellate\nTribunal  which was denied to those persons whose cases\t had\nbeen referred by the Central Government for investigation by\nthe Commission under s.5(1) of Act XXX of 1947.\n   Different persons, though falling under the same class or\ncategory  of  substantial  evaders  of\tincome-tax,   would,\ntherefore, be subject to different procedures, one a summary\nand drastic procedure and the other a normal procedure which\ngave  to the assessees various rights which were  denied  to\nthose  who  were  specially  treated  under  the   procedure\nprescribed in Act XXX of 1947.\n  Per JAGANNADHADAS J.-The class of persons falling under S.\n5(1)  of the Taxation on Income\t (Investigation\t Commission)\nAct,  1947 (Act XXX of 1947) is totally different from\tthat\nwhich  falls within-amended s. 34 of the  Indian  Income-Tax\nAct  1922 (Act XI of 1922) and therefore s. 5(1) of Act\t XXX\nof 1947 is not unconstitutional as offending Art. 14 of\t the\nConstitution.\n  Suraj Mall Mohta v.

This appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, which dismissed an appeal from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, raises a question of novelty and importance. The appellant is the Minister of National Revenue, the respondent a limited company, Anaconda American Brass Ltd.  \n 2. The Minister, on the assessment of the respondent company to income- tax and excess profits tax for the year 1947, increased the amount of taxable income declared by the company by the sum of $1,611,756.43, with the result that its excess profit tax for that year was increased by about $241,000 and its income-tax by about $483,000. Against this assessment the company appealed to the Exchequer Court : the President of the court allowed the appeal and, as already said, the Supreme Court dismissed the Minister's appeal from his judgment. It is only the excess profits tax with which this appeal is concerned.  \n 3. The excess profit tax is levied under the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, which by section 3 provides that in addition to any other tax or duty payable under any Act there shall be assessed, levied and paid a tax in accordance with the rate set out in the Second Schedule thereto upon the excess profits of every corporation or joint stock company residing or ordinarily resident in Canada or carrying on business in Canada. The rate set out in the Second Schedule is 15 per cent, of the excess profits in the case of corporation or joint stock companies. \"Profits\" in their case is by the same Act defined to mean for any taxation period the amount of net taxable income for the same period as determined under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act. Under the latter Act income is, so far as is relevant, defined as meaning the annual net profit or gain ascertained and capable of computation as being the profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business.  \n 4. The question, then, is whether the Minister correctly assessed the annual net profit or gain of the company for the year 1947 or, to state the question more accurately, whether the company has established that his assessment was incorrect.  \n 5. The material facts of the case are not in dispute.  \n 6. The company carries on the business of purchasing metals, manufacturing them into sheets, rods and tubes and selling the manufactured metals. About 98 per cent. of the metals purchased by the company consist of copper (over 80 per cent.) and zinc (about 15 per cent.). The other principal metals are lead, tin and nickel. The prices which the company charges for its products are closely related to the prices paid by it to replace the metals used in manufacturing its products, and, when market prices of purchased metals are increased, it at once correspondingly increases the prices of its products.  \n 7. The company is constantly purchasing metals to replace those that are being used. Its practice is to make an estimate at the beginning of each month of the quantity of metals which will be used during the next month and to order from its suppliers the same quantity to replace such metals. It maintains an inventory or stock of metals at all times of about one-third to one-quarter of its annual requirements, so that it turns over its inventory three or four times a year. About two-thirds of the copper and zinc inventory is continuously in process in the plant : this indicates that the average time in process is about eight weeks.  \n 8. The company did not keep records from which the actual metals used during the year could be identified or the amounts paid for those metals determined. But it kept records of the quantities of metals (a) in its inventory at the beginning of the year, (b) purchased during the year, and (c) in its inventory at the end of the year. It also kept records of the prices paid for the metals purchased from time to time.  \n 9. Thus in the year 1947 the company knew what stock it had in hand at the beginning, what stock it had purchased during the year, and what stock it had in hand at the end of it. It also know what prices it had paid during the year for the metals it purchased. But it did not know and could not ascertain either in respect of all the metals which it used during the year what price had been paid for them or in respect of all the metals which it had at the end of the year what price had been paid for them. Yet in order to determine its annual profit or gain for the year 1947 it is necessary to ascribe the proper cost to the metals used and the proper cost or value to the metals remaining in stock. In the absence of knowledge an assumption or estimate must be made and it is at this stage that the difference between the parties arises.  \n 10. It is convenient first to explain the manner in which the company made up its return for the year 1947, stating only by way of premise that, whereas the prices of raw materials had for some time before that year, been comparatively stable, in that year, as the result of the relaxation and then the removal of war-time controls, there had been large increases of price, for example, of copper on January 22 from 11.5 cents per Pound to 16.625 cents per Pound and on June 10 to 21.5 cents per Pound. It was under these circumstances that in 1947 for the first time the company made a return for income-tax purposes in which a system known as Lifo, or last-in-first-out, was adopted. It was a system which it had used for its own corporate purposes for some time previously in respect of copper, but neither it nor any other taxpayer in Canada had adopted it for taxation purposes. It must now be briefly explained.  \n 11. It must in the first place be explained that Lifo does not mean that the metal last to be received into stock is in fact the first to be processed and sold. On the contrary, the actual physical flow of the raw material is regarded as irrelevant : that which was purchased in previous years and was in stock at the opening of the relevant financial year or that which was purchased during that year may have been processed and the products sold during that year : this is of no account. It is to cost that Lifo looks, and in the simplest terms it means that the cost per pound of the metal most recently purchased and added to stock is the cost per pound of metal content to be charged against the next sale of processed metal products. It is the necessary corollary of this that to the stock which is in fact in hand at the end of the year there must be attributed the cost of metal which has not yet been exhausted by the cost attributed to metal consumed; this has been called the unabsorbed residue of cost. Thus in the case under appeal the stock of copper in hand at the close of the year 1947 (the \"closing inventory\" as it is conveniently called) consisted of 14,291,007 Pounds : and under the Lifo system it was treated as follows :  \n (a) 6,500,000 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 7.5 cents per Pound (the average cost of the copper in the inventory when Lifo was adopted in 1936) amounting to $487,500  \n \n\n (b) 802,697 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 9.466 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1936) amounting to $75,983.30;  \n (c) 17,577 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.191 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1937) amounting to $1,967.04;  \n (d) 639,807 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 10.443 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1938) amounting to $66,847.04;  \n (e) 973,477 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.036 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1939) amounting to $107,432.92;  \n (f) 3,151,684 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.5 cents per Pound (the price paid in 1945) amounting to $362,443.66;  \n (g) 2,205,765 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.5 cents per Pound (the price paid in 1946) amount to $253,662.97.   \n 12. The total cost of the 14,291,007 Pounds of copper in the closing inventory was thus assumed to have been $1,355,836.93, and this was the figure attributed to the closing inventory in the return for income-tax. It is to be observed that the price attributed by the company to nearly half its inventory was 7.5 cents per Pound, a price less than any price prevailing since 1935. The result is obvious. By attributing the higher cost to the metals processed and the lower cost to those retained in stock the company was able to show far lower profits than if it had followed the accustomed and traditional method of return. The question is whether the new method is permissible for income-tax purposes.  \n 13. It is necessary to emphasize the words \"for income-tax purposes.\" For a large part of the argument upon this appeal and throughout the proceedings has been devoted to showing that in Canada the Lifo method is in certain conditions a proper and generally accepted method of accountancy and that those conditions are conspicuously present in the case of the appellant company. This was the view accepted by the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada and by the Supreme Court. It is accepted unreservedly also by their Lordships.  \n 14. The appellant Minister took the view that, however appropriate the Lifo method might be for the corporate purposes of the company, it did not truly reflect its profit for income-tax purposes. He accordingly increased the assessable income by the sum of $1,611,756.43. In doing so he adopted the method known as the Fifo or first-in-first-out method, which assumes that the metal first purchased is the metal first used. Upon this assumption the metal in stock at the end of the year 1947 was the metal most recently purchased and inasmuch as it appeared that during the year 1947 the company purchased no less than 63,268,555 Pounds of copper and more than 14,291,007 Pounds (the quantity in the closing inventory) had been purchased at the price 215 cents per Pound in the last three months of the year, he determined the cost of the copper in the closing inventory at $3,072,566.50. This figure may be contrasted with the $1,355,836.93 appearing in the company's return.  \n 15. At this point it is possible to define more closely the position of the parties. The Minister concedes that in fact used during the financial year must be made. He does not dispute that there may be in the closing inventory some metal which had been purchased in previous years. But he contends that the method which he was adopted attains more nearly the result postulated by Lord Loreburn L.C. in Sun Insurance Office v. Clark \"that the true gains are to be ascertained as nearly as it can be done.\" He urges that it is a principle of income-tax law which has been adopted from commercial accounting practice that the values of the stock-in-trade at the beginning and end of the period covered by the account should be entered at cost or market value, whichever is the lower, and he says that for this purpose the actual stock in hand must be regarded and its actual cost so far as possible ascertained, and that an assumption or estimate is necessary only so far as ascertainment is not possible. Upon this basis he says that the Fifo method more nearly than the Lifo method represents the facts, and supports that contention by reference not only to the large purchases of metal during the last months of 1947, which can hardly have been processed during that year, but also to the fact that the Lifo method involves the assumption of 6,500,000 Pounds of copper purchased in or before 1936 being still in stock at the end of 1947. He says, therefore, that his assessment has not been displaced by any evidence that the Lifo method more nearly represents the true income of the company. He is not contend that the company (or some other taxpayer may not be able to establish that some other method than Fifo more accurately represents the income for tax purposes where the raw material used is homogeneous and no substantial part of it can be identified. Nor is it necessary for their Lordships to determine whether some other method as for instance the \"average cost\" method, may not in some circumstances be properly adopted for tax purposes. What the Minister urges is that the Lifo method does not more nearly than Fifo produce the true income in the present case, and that is the question for their Lordships' decision.  \n 16. The company, on the other hand, contends that, inasmuch as the Income War Tax Act does not contain any definition of \"annual net profit or gain,\" nor any directions how profits or cost of sales are to be ascertained, these matters can only be determined by the application of ordinary commercial principles except where such principles are expressly excluded by the Act. It then says that it is a question of fact what are ordinary commercial principles and that the president of the Exchequer Court has found as a fact, and the majority of the Supreme Court has concurred in his finding, that the company's return had been made in accordance with those principles. The contention, in short, is that annual income for income-tax purposes is determined by accepted accountancy practice unless the Act otherwise provides, and that in the present case the President has found not only that Lifo was an acceptable accounting method but that it was the most acceptable method and that the method adopted by the Minister was not a Proper one.  \n 17. These contentions of the company have been, in their Lordships' opinion, rejected by the minority of the Supreme Court (Kerwin C.J. and Estey J.). The income-tax law of Canada, as of the United Kindom, is built upon the foundations described by Lord Clyde in Whimster & Co. v. Inland Revenue Commissioner in a passage cited by the Chief Justice which may be here repeated. 'In the first place, the profits of any particular year or accounting period must be taken to consist of the difference between the receipts from the trade or business during such year or accounting period and the expenditure laid out to earn those receipts. In the second place, the account of profit and loss to be made up for the purpose of ascertaining that difference must be framed consistently with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, so far as applicable, and in conformity with the rules of the Income-Tax Act, or of that Act as modified by the provisions and schedules of the Acts regulating Excess profit Duty, as the case may be. For example, the ordinary principles of commercial accounting require that in the profit and loss account of a merchant's or manufacturer's business the values of the stock-in-trade at the beginning and at the end of the period covered by the account should be entered at cost or market price, whichever is the lower; although there is nothing about this in the statutes.\" For many years before and ever since this decision what is to be valued at the beginning and end of the accounting period has for tax purposes been taken to be the actual stock so far as it can be ascertained. It is in fact, so far as tax law is concerned, a novel and even revolutionary proposal that the physical facts should even where they can wholly or partly be ascertained be disregarded for the purpose of the opening and closing inventory and a theoretical assumption made which is based on a supposed \"flow of cost\" and an \"unabsorbed residue of cost.\" An expert witness called for the company observed that he did not imagine any of the company's witness would claim for a minute that there was a quantity of metal then on hand acquired in the year 1936 equal to the quality which was valued at the then cost. Yet there was no less than six and a half million pounds of copper in the 1947 closing inventory to which the 1936 cost was ascribed. He might have added that year by year the same thing would happened so long as the business went on and existing stocks were not seriously diminished : in 1987 as in 1947 the closing inventory would carry stock to which 1936 costs would be ascribed. This illustrates clearly the Lifo method which and shows how far it has travelled from the conception which has prevailed in the assessment of income for tax purposes.  \n 18. It was strongly pressed by the respondent that in dealing with homogeneous material the actual user test, if it could be applied by identification of parcels purchased at varying prices, would lead to capricious and illogical results. Assuming that this is so and that actual user should not in some cases be regarded as the final test, this does not in their Lordship's opinion establish the case for Lifo. It might be that in such cases, properly be adopted, for that method, like the Fifo method, brings into the account the cost of every purchase in its order. But the present case shows that under the Lifo method, if the business continues and stock is carried forward, substantial purchases may never come into the profit account at all.  \n 19. Their Lordships do not question that the Lifo method or some variant or it may be appropriate for the corporate purposes of a trading company. Business men and their accountant advisers must have in mind not only the fiscal year with which alone the Minister is concerned. It may well be prudent for them to carry in their books stocks valued at a figure which represents neither value nor its actual cost but the lower cost at which similar stock was brought long ago. A hidden reserve is thus created which may be of use in future years. But the Income-Tax Act is not in the year 1947 concerned with the years 1948 or 1949 : by that time the company may have gone out of existence and its assets been distributed. Seventy years ago Lord Herschell said in resell surplus by which the receipts from the trade or business excess the expenditure necessary for the purpose of earning those rejects.\" This is only one of many judicial observations in which it is implicit that no assumption need be made unless cannot be ascertained, and then only to the extent to which they cannot be ascertained. There is no room for theories as to flow of costs, nor is it legitimate to regard the closing inventory as an unabsorbed residue of costs rather than as a concrete stock of metals awaiting the day of process. It is in their Lordship's opinion the failure to observe, or perhaps it should be said, the deliberated disregard of, facts which can be ascertained and must have their proper weight ascribed to them, which vitiates the application of the Lifo method to the present case. It is the same consideration which makes it clear that the evidence of export witness, that the Lifo method is a generally acceptable, and in this case the most appropriate, method of accountancy, is not conclusive of the question that the court has to decide. That may be found as a fact by the Exchequer Court and affirmed by the Supreme Court. The question remains whether it conforms to the prescription of the Income-Tax Act. As already indicated, in their Lordships' opinion it does not.  \n 20. The history of the adoption of the Lifo method in Canada by the company and presumably by other companies is of some interest. The method appears to have originated in the U.S.A. and there to have been adopted by an American corporation which was the parent of the respondent company some time before 1938. But it was only by an amendment of the existing revenue law that it was in that year permitted to be adopted for tax purposes. In 1939 further amendments were made and the method is now permitted subject to statutory conditions which are summarized in the judgment of Estey J. in the Supreme Court. The many different which exist between the revenue laws of the U.S.A. and Canada do not permit too much weight to the fact that it is sought to do in Canada without legislation what in the U.S.A. is only permissible with statutory safeguards. But it at least supports the view that theories of accountancy, though they may be accepted and put into practice by business men, do not finally determine a trading company's income for tax purposes. Again, though their Lordships recognize that this appeal must be determined by reference to Canadian law, they notice that in the U.S.A., in a case in which the so - called \"base stock\" method was under discussion, Brandeis J. used words which are apt to describe the Lifo method also. \"In years of rising price, the \"base stock\" method causes an understatement of income; for it disregards the gains actually realized through liquidation of law price stock on a high price market... This method may, like many reserves which business men set up on their books for their own purposes, serve to equalize the results of operations during a series of years...\" : see Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co. 1. In this passage the distribution is nicely made between what is permitted for tax purposes and what prudent business men may think fit to do.  \n 21. So, also, in the United Kingdom an attempt has been vainly made to uphold the base stock method for income-tax purposes. In the recent case of Patrick v. Broadstone Mills Ltd. 2 Singleton L.J., in words that are equally apt if applied to the Lifo method, declined to accept the base stock method as conformable to income tax law, though it might be approved by accountancy practice.  \n 22. In the result Lordships are of opinion that this appeal must be allowed, the judgments of the appeal of the respondent company from the Minister's assessment rejected, and they will humbly advise Her Majesty accordingly. They repeat that they have reached this conclusion not because they dissent from any finding of fact by the President of the Exchequer Court, of whose lucid and exhaustive judgment no criticism can from this aspect fairly be made, but because his findings of fact do not offer a complete solution of the question.  \n 23. The respondent company must pay the costs of this appeal and of the proceedings in the courts of Canada. \n"}, {"id": "1436728", "date": "12/1955", "tagline": "Thakur Pratap Singh vs Shri Krishna Gupta And Ors. on 2 December, 1955", "judgment": " *               *               *               *\n \n\n (c) that there has been any failure to comply with any of the provisions of clause (i).........\".    \n \n\n 12.

They  returned\na verdict of not guilty in respect of both the charges.\t The\nSessions  Judge,  disagreeing with the verdict of  the\tjury\nunder s. 477-A, referred the matter to the High Court  under\ns. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Against\nthis  conviction the appellant appealed to the\tHigh  Court.\nBoth  the  reference under s. 307 of the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure  and\tthe appeal were heard together by  the\tHigh\nCourt  which confirmed the appellant's conviction  under  s.\n409  and  the  sentence passed by  the\tSessions  Judge\t and\ndisagreeing with the verdict of the jury it held him  guilty\nunder  s.  477-A and sentenced him to  two  years'  rigorous\nimprisonment.\tOn  appeal by special leave to\tthe  Supreme\nCourt:-\nHeld  (i) that the contention that when the  Sessions  Judge\ndisagreed  with the verdict of the jury and the\t opinion  of\nthe assessors,\n1036\nhe  should have referred the whole case under s. 307 of\t the\nCode of Criminal Procedure to the High Court and not  merely\nthat part of it which related to the charge under s.  477-A,\nI.P.C.\twas  without force because the\tSessions  Judge\t had\ncontravened no provision of law and committed no  illegality\nin  deciding the case which related to the charge  under  s.\n409, I.P.C. That s. 307, Code of Criminal Procedure  applies\nin terms only to trials by a jury and the Sessions Judge had\nno  power under that section to refer cases tried  with\t the\naid of assessors for the decision of the High Court.  In the\npresent case there was the further fact that both the appeal\nagainst\t the  conviction  under\t s.  409,  I.P.C.  and\t the\nreference under s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  in\nrespect of the charge under s. 477-A were disposed of by the\nsame judgment;\n(ii)that the contention that the appellant's true status was\nthat  of  a  servant and not that of an agent  and  that  he\nshould have been tried not under s. 409, I.P.C. but under s.\n408,  I.P.C. was also without force inasmuch as\t his  status\nwas  that of an agent and not that of a servant in  view  of\nhis  duties  as Secretary of the Society.   The\t distinction\nbetween\t the  two is this a servant acts  under\t the  direct\ncontrol and supervision of the master, and is bound to\tcon-\nform to all reasonable orders given to him in the course  of\nhis work. An agent though bound to exercise his authority in\naccordance  with all lawful instructions which may be  given\nto him from time to time by his principal, is not subject in\nits  exercise  to the direct control or supervision  of\t the\nprincipal;\n(iii)that the contention that there had been violation of s.\n234 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in that the  appellant\nhad  been charged with three offences under s.\t409,  I.P.C.\nand  one under s. 477-A was also without force as  the\tcase\nwas governed by s. 235 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  as\nthe  several  offences under s. 409, I.P.C.  and  s.  477-A,\nI.P.C.\tarose  out of the same acts and formed part  of\t the\nsame transaction.\nEmperor v.

Even if it\twere\nto  be\tregarded as an enhancement, the order  of  the\tHigh\nCourt  could not be held to be bad for want of notice  under\ns.  439(2),  as the first appellant had\t an  opportunity  of\nshowing\t cause against the conviction and enhancement,\tand,\nin any event, no prejudice had resulted to him by reason  of\nthe absence of a formal notice under the section.\nIbrahim\t v.

The only question canvassed before us in the above appeals, which have been heard together, is whether certain sales of goods made by Shri Ganesh Jute Mills Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Mills) to the Government of India, Ministry of Industry and Supplies are to be deducted from the taxable turnover of the Mills so as to be exempt from sales tax demanded by the Commercial Tax officer of the State of West Bengal. The relevant facts are stated below.  \n2. On the first of September 1948 the Government of India, Ministry of Industry and Supplies, in Calcutta, placed with the Mills a confirmatory order in writing bearing No. Cal/J - 1/2001/103 for the supply to the Government of India of a large quantity of hessian cloth of different descriptions at different prices therein mentioned. It was stipulated that the contract would be governed by the conditions of contract specified in Form WSB 133 as amended up-to-date. It was specifically mentioned that the goods ordered were required to meet an international obligation of the Government of India and as such the execution of the contract in accordance with the programme of deliveries as given in the schedule attached thereto was essential. The agreed prices were stated to be exclusive of the Bengal Sales Tax and it was stipulated that the Government of India would arrange direct payment of sales tax to the Government of West Bengal if it was ultimately found that Sales Tax was payable in respect of that contract. Pursuant to the aforesaid contract, the Mills supplied goods to the Government of India of the aggregate value of Rs. 2,10,040 calculated at the prices agreed upon.  \n3. The Commercial Tax Officer, Beadon Street, District II Charge, claimed that the aforesaid sales should be included in the taxable turnover of the Mills and assessed to sales tax. The Mills, on the other hand, claimed exemption under section 5 of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 (Bengal Act VI of 1941). The relevant portion of section 5 ran as follows :-  \n  \"5. (1) The tax payable by a dealer under this Act shall be levied at the rate of one quarter of an anna in the rupee on his taxable turnover;  \n (2) In this Act the expression \"taxable turnover\" means that part of a dealer's gross turnover during any period which remains, after deducting therefrom -  \n (a) his turnover during that period on -  \n (i)....................... \n (ii)...................... \n (iii) sales to the Indian Stores Department the Supply Department of the Government of India, and any railway or water transport administration;  \n (iv)..................... \n (v)...................... \n (vi)..................... \n (b)......................\"   \n4. The Mills further contended that if any sales tax was at all payable the same was payable by the Government of India and not by them. The Commercial Tax Officer overruled both these objections and on the 8th November 1950 he assessed the Mills to sales tax in respect of the supplies made by the Mills to the Government of India under the aforesaid contract and demanded a sum of Rs. 9,401-10-6.  \n5. On the 6th December 1950 the Mills filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution of India before the High Court at Calcutta. In the petition the Mills impleaded as respondents the Commercial Tax Officer, the State of West Bengal and the Union of India. The Mills prayed for a writ of mandamus on the respondents to cancel and/or recall and/or forbear from acting or giving effect to the demand dated the 8th November, 1950 and from realising the sum of Rs. 9,401-10-6 and for a writ of certiorari for production of the records and proceedings before the Commercial Tax Officer and for quashing the same and for the other incidental reliefs. On the same day a rule was issued on the respondents to show cause why the orders prayed for should not be made.  \n6. The Commercial Tax Officer filed an affidavit in opposition disputing the contentions put forward by the Mills in support of their claim for exemption and maintaining that sales tax was due and had been legitimately assessed and demanded. On behalf of the Union of India was filed and affidavit affirmed by one M. P. Pai, the then Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Works, Production & Supply. It was therein stated that a Department of the Government of India named the Department of Supply came into existence in the month of September 1939 immediately on the commencement of World War II and before the enactment of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 (Bengal Act VI of 1941). It was averred that before the 7th January, 1946 the said Department of Supply was charged with the procurement of Stores from all places in India including Bengal and that it also directed the work of Indian Stores Department in the United Kingdom and of the India Supply Mission in the United States of America. It was added that by Resolution No. 227/45-Pub(c) dated that 31st December, 1945 the Government-General in Council announced the creation with effect from the 7th January, 1946 of the Department of Industries & Supply in place of the existing Department of Supply and of Industries and Civil Supplies. It was claimed that powers and functions of the Department of Industries and Supplies were the same as those of the Department of Supply and that there was no variation in the nature of the said functions whatsoever.  \n7. The rule came up for hearing before Bose, J., who took the view that the newly created Department of Industries & Supplies was charged with the same work of procurement of stores for Government as had been entrusted to the Department of Supply and certain additional works and that later on the name was again changed to Ministry of Industry and Supply. The learned Judge pointed out that although there was a change in the designation of the Indian Stores Department and the Supply Department of the Government of India, section 5(2)(a)(iii) was not amended in any way until 1949 when by an amending Act (West Bengal Act X of 1949) the exemption granted under section 5(2)(a)(iii) was withdrawn. The learned Judge appears to have regarded this continuance of section 5(2)(a)(iii) in the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 as indicative of the fact that in view of the State of West Bengal the Ministry of Industry & Supply was the same as the Indian Stores Department and the Supply Department of the Government of India referred to in the section. The learned Judge accordingly held that the Mills were entitled to the benefit of the exemption and were not liable to pay sales tax in respect of the supplies in question. He accordingly, on the 3rd January, 1952, made the rule absolute.  \n8. The Commercial Tax Officer and the State of West Bengal went up on appeal from the said judgment and order of Bose, J. The appeal came up for hearing before a Bench consisting of K. C. Das Gupta, J. and P. N. Mookerjee, J. In separate but concurring judgments both the learned Judges rejected the preliminary objection taken by the Mills and the Union of India as to the maintainability of the appeal. On the merits both of them held that the Department of Industries & Supplies was not the same as the Indian Stores Department or the Supply Department of the Government of India. The old departments ceased to exist and a new department combining some of the functions of these departments and some new functions was created and that, therefore, sales to the newly created department could not be deducted from the taxable turnover under section 5(2)(a)(iii). In the result, the Appeal Court allowed the appeal with costs, set aside the order of Bose, J. and dismissed the application of the Mills under Article 226. The Mills as well as the Union of India, have now come up on appeal before us with a certificate of fitness granted by the High Court.  \n9. In view of the decision of this Court in National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. ([1953] S.C.R. 1028), the question of maintainability of the appeal before the High Court has not been raised before us. The appeals have been fought out on the merits only.  \n10. The appeals came up before this Court for hearing on the 22nd and 23rd September 1955. After going through the records it was felt that the materials on record were not sufficient to enable the Court to determine the real point of controversy between the parties. The appeals were accordingly adjourned and directions were given for the filing of supplementary affidavits setting out the facts relied on by the parties respectively. Fresh affidavits have since been filed.  \n11. It appears from the affidavit of one A. R. Iyer, Deputy Director, Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals, under the Ministry of Works, Housing & Supply, that in 1918 a department called the Contracts Directorate had been constituted as a purchasing organisation for the needs of the Army. With effect from the 1st January, 1922 the Indian Stores Department was constituted as a result of the recommendations of the Stores Purchase Committee. The functions of this department were to act as a purchasing and inspection agency in respect of certain commodities including textile goods for all Central Departments and minor Local Government and such other authorities as might desire to avail themselves of the services of this department. Annexure III to affidavit of Iyer indicates that it was not obligatory on the other departments to make purchases through the Indian Stores Department. Originally this department was constituted for a period of two years but by Resolution No. S. 217 of the Government of India, dated the 6th May, 1924, it was placed on a permanent basis and continued to discharge the same functions. Rules 5 and 6 attached to this Resolution show that purchases could also be made locally by other departments in case of emergency or for convenience.  \n12. In 1939 when the outbreak of World War II was imminent the necessity for creating a new department was keenly felt and the Governor-General in Council by a Resolution of the Home Department dated the 26th August, 1939 (Annexure V to Iyer's affidavit) announced the creation from that date of a department of Supply \"to deal directly with questions concerning supplies of all kinds required for the prosecution of war\". Annexure VIII to Iyer's affidavit shows that the control of the Indian Stores Department and all other matters relating to the purchase of stores in India which were being then dealt with in the Department of Commerce were to be dealt with in the department of Supply as a temporary measure for the duration of the war. That the Indian Stores Department and the Contracts Directorate did not lose their identity is shown by the Office Memorandum dated the 3rd August, 1940 (Annexure X, Clause 4) and Office Memorandum dated the 2nd December, 1941 (Annexure XI, Clause 1(a) and Clause 4). It is thus clear that up to the end of the year 1940 purchases used to be made for and on account of the Government of India by the Contracts Directorate, the Indian Stores Department and the Department of Supply and that purchases were also made locally by other departments. It was then that on the 1st July 1941 the Bengal Legislature passed the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 which by section 5(2)(a)(iii) exempted sales to the Indian Stores Department, the Supply Department of the Government of India and any railway or water transport administration from sales tax. Sales to other Departments of the Government of India were not so exempted.  \n13. By a Press Note dated the 2nd September 1941 issued by the Government of India in the Supply Department (Annexure XIII to Iyer's Affidavit) a Purchase Branch of the Supply Department for the duration of the war was created with effect from the 1st August, 1941 and it shows that the Contracts Directorate and the Indian Stores Department had then \"ceased to exist as separate entities\" for the duration of the war and a new branch was being organised in their place.  \n14. Then came the Office Memorandum dated the 23rd December, 1941 issued by the Government of India in the Department of Supply (Annexure XIV) which superseded the previous office memorandum dated the 13th December, 1940 (Annexure XII). The authorities under the Central Government concerned with the production, manufacture and purchase of supplies were shown in Statement I annexed thereto. It is clearly mentioned therein that departments other than the ones referred to therein were and, in the absence of orders to the contrary, would remain independent of the department though working in close touch with it (Clause 3). Powers of local purchase were also not distributed in any way (Clause 4). Statement I indicates that purchases of various supplies, e.g., medical and veterinary supplies, coal and coke for Railway and other civil and military authorities in India, etc., and Printing and Stationary stores, were independent of the Supply Department. It is thus clear that the Indian Stores Department and the supply Department of the Government of India were not the only Departments which had authority to make purchases for and on behalf of the Government of India in its various departments.  \n15. On the 21st April 1943 came Notification No. 209 - No. 107/43-Pub(c) whereby the Governor-General in Council announced the creation, from the 22nd April, 1943, of the Department of Industries and Civil Supplies to deal with (i) Statistics and Research, (ii) Development and (iii) Controls. Shortly thereafter Office Memorandum No. E4 (179) dated the 14th May, 1943 issued by the Department of Supply intimated that the Governor-General in Council had decided that the Department of Industries and Civil Supplies would, with effect from the 15th May, 1943, take over responsibility for the procurement of cotton textiles and cotton textile stores (Annexure XVI to Iyer's affidavit). So this Department of Industries and Civil Supplies became another purchasing organisation of the Government of India apart from the Department of Supply.  \n16. The Government of India Resolution dated the 31st December, 1945 announced the creation, with effect from the 7th January, 1946, of the Department of Industries and Supplies in place of the existing Department of Supply and the Department of Industries and Civil Supplies. By this Resolution the Indian Stores Department and the Contracts Directorate which during the war had been brought under the Supply Department, were incorporated in the newly created department. It will be noticed that this newly created department had assigned to it the work of the procurement of stores for the Government of India which was formerly assigned to the Department of Supply and the Department of Industries and Civil Supplies. In addition to these duties this department was authorised also to deal with other things, namely, development of industries, administration of Government factories not allocated to specialised departments, Disposals of Surplus and Civil Supplies. The nature and volume of the purchases made by this newly created department became obviously different from and larger than those of the two departments it replaced. It is also to noteworthy that the Department of Supply which was created for the prosecution of war was abolished as soon as the war was over (Annexure XVII to the affidavit of Iyer).  \n17. The Resolution of the Government of India dated the 2nd September 1947 published in the Gazette of India dated the 6th September, 1947 (Annexure XVIII) announced, amongst other things, that with effect from the 29th August 1947 the Department of Industries and Supplies would be re-designated as the Ministry of Industries and Supply.  \n18. From the summary of the annexures to the affidavit of Iyer filed in these proceedings it is quite clear that while the Ministry of Industries and Supply was a new designation of the Department of Industries and Supplies, the Department of Industries and Supplies cannot be regarded merely as a new designation of the Department of Supply and the Department of Industries and Civil Supplies. Indeed, the Resolution announced the \"creation\" of the Department of Industries and Supplies in place of the two existing Departments mentioned above. This newly created department had wider powers and was a new department altogether. The exemption granted by the Bengal Finance (Sales-Tax) Act, 1941 was given to two Departments by name. It was not given to the sales to the Government of India in all its departments. It is true that the Indian Stores Department and the Supply Department of the Government of India were not corporate bodies but they evidently were sufficiently well defined organizations to be referred to as \"entities\" in some of the Press Notes and Resolutions mentioned above and even in the affidavits filed in these proceedings. Further, the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 by section 5(2)(a)(iii) certainly dealt with these two departments as if they were distinct entities. The Act, in a manner, conferred on these two Departments the status, as it were, of well defined and distinct entities at least for the purposes of that Act, namely for making sales to them exempt from the tax. If it were the object of the Bengal Legislature to give exemption to all sales to all departments of the Government of India it would have been quite easy for it to frame sub-clause (iii) in a general way as sub-clause (iv) had been framed. Further, if sales to these two departments were to be regarded as covering sales to all departments of the Government of India then the sales to the Railways which at that time mostly, if not wholly, belonged to the Government of India need not have been separately mentioned in the way it has been in sub-clause (iii). As already stated, there were, at the date when the Act was passed, various other departments of the Government of India which were concerned with purchase of stores but quite clearly the exemption conferred by the section was not intended to extend to the sales to those departments. Therefore, the reference to these two particular departments in the section cannot possibly be read as a reference to the Government of India generally.  \n19. It has been urged that the real object of section 5(2)(a)(iii) was to give exemption not to the particular departments but to the sales of such goods as, at the date of the Act, used to be made to those Departments and, therefore, sales of those goods made to any department of the Government of India which came to be charged with the duty of purchasing those goods should also come within the purview of the section and be entitled to the benefit of the exemption conferred by it. We are unable to accept this line of reasoning This interpretation will unduly narrow the scope and ambit of the exemption by limiting it to sales of only those goods as, at the date of the Act, used to be sold to those two departments and sales of other goods even to those two departments, however necessary for the prosecution of the war, would not get the benefit of the exemption. Such could not possibly be the intention of the legislature as expressed by the language used by it in framing the section. According to the section the exemption is given to all sales made to those two departments, no matter whether the sales were only of the kind of goods which used to be sold to them at the date of the Act or of other kinds of goods. The suggested interpretation involves the addition of qualifying words to the section which ordinarily it is not permissible for the court to do. Further, the press notes and the resolutions of the Government of India summarised above clearly indicate that there were other purchasing departments which were independent of the Indian Stores Department or the Supply Department of the Government of India and that the authority of other departments of making local purchases was interfered with by the creation of these two departments. Therefore it may well have been that, at the date of the passing of the Act, same or similar kinds of goods used to be sold to these two departments as well as to other departments but surely it cannot be contended, in view of the language of the section, that the exemption was intended to extend to the sales of the same or similar kinds of goods to those other departments also. It is not necessary for us to pronounce any opinion as to the validity or soundness of the extreme position taken up by the learned Advocate-General of West Bengal namely that as the exemption is given by a statute to sales made to two departments eo nomine it will not extend to sales made to the same department re-designated by a new name. It is enough for our present purpose to say that the Department of Industries and Supplies which was subsequently re-designated as the Ministry of Industries and Supply was not the same as the Indian Stores Department or the Supply Department of the Government of India under a different name. The scope and volume of the work entrusted to the Department of Industries and Supplies was much wider and larger than that with which the two departments which it replaced had been charged. Unlike those of the two departments, its purchases were not confined to goods necessary for the prosecution of the war. To extend the benefit of the statutory exemption to the sales made to the newly created department of Industries and Supplies, of goods not required for war purposes but, say, for meeting international obligations as in the present case, will necessary widen the scope of the exemption an impose greater loss of revenue on the State of West Bengal than what the Act by its language intends to do. In view of the ever expanding activities of the modern welfare State in different fields including that of trade and commerce, the Government departments are often entrusted with the performance of well defined activities and are authorised to deal with the outside world and to enter into contracts of sale and purchase and other transactions in the same way as an ordinary person or company may do. Such Government Departments, therefore, may well be regarded as distinct units or quasi legal entities, at least for the particular purposes for which they are created. At any rate, the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 by providing for the deduction of the sales to the two named departments from the taxable turnover certainly treated those two departments as distinct entities. This exemption is the creation of the statute and must be construed strictly and cannot be extended to sales to other departments. The fact that the section was not amended until 1949 does not at all indicate that the Bengal Legislature intended to extend the benefit of the section to any but the departments specifically mentioned in the section. In our opinion the conclusion arrived at by the Appeal Court, namely that the sales tax is payable on the sale in question is correct and these appeals must be dismissed with costs.  \n Sinha J. \n20. I regret to have to differ from my learned brethren in the determination of the only question involved in these appeals, namely, whether the sales by the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 10 of 1954 (Messrs Shree Ganesh Jute Mills Ltd.) to the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 9 of 1954 the Union of India (the Government of India at the time of the transactions in question) were liable to payment of sales tax under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 (Bengal Act VI of 1941), to be referred to hereinafter as \"The Act\".  \n21. The facts leading up to these appeals may shortly be stated as follows : The Government of India in the Ministry of Industry and Supply which for the sake of brevity may be called \"The Government\" entered into a contract on the 1st September, 1948 with Messrs Shree Ganesh Jute Mills Ltd., which may be designated \"The Mills\", for the supply of hessian at certain rates and of certain description appearing in Exhibit A to the affidavit filed on behalf of the Mills. With reference to the question of sales tax the contract contains the following stipulation :-  \n  \"The prices shown above are exclusive of the Bengal Sales Tax. The Government of India will arrange direct payment of sales tax to the Government of West Bengal if it is ultimately found that sales tax is payable in respect of this contract\".  \n22. It is also provided that \"This contract will be governed by the conditions of contract specified in Form WSB. 133 as amended up to date\". This contract was entered into and signed by \"A Huq, Deputy Director of Supplies, for and on behalf of the Government-General of India\". In pursuance of the aforesaid contract the Mills supplied hessian goods to the Government of India of a certain valuation on which the Commercial Tax Officer of Bengal, the main contesting respondent, made a demand of Rs. 9,401-10-6 as sales tax from the Mills. The Mills demurred to the payment and contended that the sales in question were exempt from payment of the sales tax demanded in view of the provisions of section 5(2)(a)(iii) of the Act. Eventually the Mills moved the High Court of Calcutta for an appropriate writ under article 226 of the Constitution against the contesting respondents. The matter was heard by a Single Judge of that Court who by his judgment dated the 6th December, 1951 held that the Mills were not liable to pay the sales tax demanded and cancelled the notice of demand and directed the respondents 1 and 2 to forbear from enforcing the demand. Respondents 1 and 2 went up in appeal under the Letters Patent. The appeal was heard by a Division Bench which came to the contrary conclusion. The major portion of the judgment of the Letters Patent Bench was devoted to the discussion of the question whether the judgment of the learned Single Judge in the writ matter was amenable to the appellate jurisdiction under the Letters Patent. That question has not been pressed during the arguments and is therefore no more in controversy. The only question that was canvassed before us was the applicability of section 5(2)(a)(iii) of the Act which contains the exemption, the benefit of which is being sought by the appellants in each case. The exemption is in these terms :-  \n  \"Sales to the Indian Stores Department, the Supply Department of the Government of India, and any railway or water transport administration\".  \n23. It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that the sale of hessian by the Mills to the Government of India in the Ministry of Industry and Supply is within the terms of the exemption quoted above. On the other hand, it is contended on behalf of the Sales Tax Department of the Government of West Bengal that the sales in question were not covered by the aforesaid exemption clause. It is a therefore necessary to go into some detail of the formation and development of the Department in question.  \n24. The supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the Government and sworn to by Shri A. R. Iyer, Deputy Director of Directorate General of Supplies & Disposals, discloses the following facts. The Indian Stores Department was constituted with effect from the 1st January, 1922 as a result of the recommendation of the Stores Purchase Committee which had been constituted by the Government of India to examine the whole question of the Constitution of an expert agency to carry out on a large scale purchase of supplies required for the public services, as recommended by the Indian Industrial Commission, with the object of encouraging the purchase of articles made in India for Government requirements. The scope and functions of the department, inter alia, were to act as a purchasing and inspection agency, and in an advisory capacity in all matters connected with the purchase of stores for the public services, on behalf of all Central Departments of the Government and of the minor local Governments and also on behalf of such major local Governments, Company worked Railways, Corporations, Port Trusts, Municipalities and quasi public bodies and Indian States as might desire to avail themselves of the Department's Assistance. The activities of the Department consisted in the purchase and inspection in India of a large variety of goods and articles including \"textile goods\", so that the purchase of hessian which is the particular commodity involved in this case, would be included in the activities of the Department. The Department had been constituted in the first instance for a period of two years. But by a Resolution of the Government of India dated the 6th May 1924 it was placed on a permanent basis. It continued to discharge the same functions as before. It made purchases not only for the needs of the Civilian Departments of the Government of India but also of all the requirements of the Army. Hessian which had been purchased from the Mills in this case was one of the products which the Government of India used to purchase only through the Indian Stores Department whenever needed for Government purposes. A Department called the \"Contracts Directorate\" had been constituted in 1918 as a purchasing organization for the needs of the Army. But after the constitution of the Indian Stores Department in 1922 the Army authorities also began to utilize the services of the Indian Stores Department for procurement of several categories of stores required by them. By a resolution of the home Department dated the 26th August, 1939, apparently to meet the demands of the imminent second world war, the Contracts Directorate and the Indian Stores Department were in 1940 amalgamated with the Department of Supply so that in 1941, when the Act was passed, the position was that Department of Supply as reorganized on the 3rd August, 1940 included amongst its activities and functions the purchase of stores for the needs of the Government. This Branch of its activity was administered by the Directorate General, Supply Branch, located at New Delhi. Jute products and textiles including hessian had to be purchased only by placing indents by the department concerned with the Directorate General of Supply, New Delhi. Thus this Department absorbed for the duration of the war the purchasing sections of the Indian Stores Department and the Contracts Directorate which were placed under completely self-contained organizations empowered to procure supplies, whether for war purposes or otherwise. All authorities requiring supplies to be procured in India had to place their indents or demands on the Directorate General concerned. With effect from the 1st August, 1941 the Contracts Directorate and the Indian Stores Department ceased to exist as separate entities in the Supply Department and became one purchasing organization in the said Department. This organisation arranged for supply of all classes of stores for purposes of Government, such as textiles, leather goods, etc. Thus hessian which came under the head of \"textiles\" which was being purchased in the first instance only by the Indian Stores Department continued to be purchased by the Supply Department when the Indian Stores Department came under the control of the Supply Department. By a notification dated the 21st April, 1943 issued by the Government of India in the Home Department, another Department called the Industries and Civil Supplies Department was created. This Department was primarily concerned with statistics and research and development of industries, as also controls on civil supplies (other than foodstuffs). When this Department was first created, it had no purchasing activity. But with effect from the 15th May, 1943 the Government Directed that the new department should take over responsibility for the procurement of cotton textiles and cotton textile stores which till then were being dealt with by the Indian Stores Department which later came under the Supply Department as aforesaid. Purchase of jute and woollen textiles continued to be the responsibility of the Supply Department. By a Resolution of the Government of India dated the 31st December, 1945 the Department of Industries and Supplies in place of the existing Departments of Supply and of Industries and Civil Supplies were created with effect from the 7th January, 1946. From that date the Department of Industries and Supplies became responsible for the procurement of stores from all places in India in the same manner as the Department of Supply had been doing previously to its amalgamation with the new Department. The powers and functions of the Department of Industries and Supplies in the matter of procurement of stores continued as before. The Department continued to procure and purchase only the same kinds of articles as the Department of Supply had been doing before the coming into existence of the Department of Industries and Supplies so that the creation of the Department of Industries and Supplies did not make any difference in its activities relating to purchase of stores. There was no addition to or subtraction from its functions in the matter of purchase of stores.  \n25. From what has been stated above, it is clear that the purchasing functions of the Government of India with special reference to the procurement of textiles including hessian with which we are immediately concerned were discharged by the Indian Stores Department from 1st January, 1922. Those functions were taken over by the Department of Supply in 1940.  \n26. The Department of Supply itself merged in the Department of Industries and Supplies with effect from 7th January, 1946. By a notification of the 2nd September, 1947 the Department of Industries and Supplies was redesignated as the Ministry of Industry and Supply with effect from the 29th August, 1947 as a result of the emergence of India as an Independent State. Thus the Ministry of Industry and Supply is a lineal descendant of the Indian Stores Department, of course, with an added volume of work and functions, but the original activity of purchase of stores remaining the same in bulk and in character. It has already been notified that the Indian Stores Department was concerned with the function, amongst others, of purchasing stores of a large variety of articles and goods on behalf of all Central Departments of the Government of India and Local Governments, Railways Companies, Corporations, Port Trusts, Municipalities and other quasi public bodies, as also Indian States if they availed of the services of the department. Thus the infant Indian Stores Department has grown in stature and volume in the course of the last about 25 years. The same sapling has grown into a shady tree but its function as the sole purchasing agency of the Government of India and other Governments for a large variety of goods and commodities has continued. The nomenclature has undergone successive changes, but the function of purchasing agency on behalf of the Central and other, Governments and public bodies as aforesaid has remained the same. Furthermore, the purchase of hessian, which is the subject-matter of the demand in question has continued in the same organization, though under a different name.  \n27. It is well settled that the provisions of a statute have to be construed with reference to the state of affairs as they existed at the time the statute was passed. In the year 1941 there was in existence the Supply Department of the Government of India which has incorporated the Indian Stores Department. According to the affidavit referred to above, the main activities of purchase of goods and commodities required by the Government of India and the Governments, local bodies, etc., except for purchases of small values, that is to say, not exceeding Rs. 100 in each case and of certain specified commodities like foodstuffs, forage, lethal stores, etc. referred to in para. 7 of the affidavit (at p. 18 of the supplementary paper book) were carried on by the Supply Department. That is the reason why the exemption to the Government of India was worded as it stands in section 5(2)(a)(iii). As stated above, the Supply Department existed as a separate department up to the 6th January, 1946. With effect from the 7th January the Department of Industries & Supplies came into existence which later was re-designated as the Ministry of Industry Supply. The judgment under appeal is based chiefly on the consideration that the exemption clause in question does not in terms refer to the newly created department which now goes by the name of the Ministry of Industry & Supply. But this department in so far as it deals with industry, is not concerned with the main purchasing activities of the Government of India. The exemption was granted in respect of the purchasing activity of the Government of India and that function continues to be assigned to the Supply Department which has now become a wing of the newly created department of the Government. The question therefore arises whether in those circumstances the Government of India could claim the benefit of the exemption. The High Court in answering that question in the negative has gone upon mere nomenclature. It has emphasized the change in the name and overlooked the substance of the matter.  \n28. After all, what is a Department of a Government ? It is not a mere name, whatever else it may be. It is not a person, either natural or artificial. A Department of Government is a particular function. The Government has so many functions and each of its functions or a group of functions is placed in charge of a particular Department which may be made up of a number of clerks organized in a group, whose work is supervised by a hierarchy of officials with the head of the department at the apex. A department may therefore consist of a single function out of the many functions of the Government, or it may comprise several functions placed in charge of a single departmental head. The Indian Stores Department which came to be incorporated in the Supply Department of the Government of India and later merged in the larger Department of the Ministry of Industry & Supply, could have continued its separate existence as it did until 1939 or could have become part of a larger department as it did after the 3rd August, 1940, or the 7th January, 1946, or the 29th August, 1947; and conversely, its activities could be split up into a number of sub-departments under different heads classified according to the nature of the commodities to be purchased. But, in my opinion, the change in the nomenclature in either direction should not matter so long as the function, namely, of purchasing articles and commodities required by the Government of India and other Governments continued to be the same. It is a matter of substance and not of form.  \n29. The Department concerned cannot be equated with a natural person. Nor can it be raised to the level of a legal person. I am not aware of any principle of jurisprudence which would justify placing a department of Government on the pedestal of a legal person. There is no tertium quid between the two positions. Though the High Court has not said so in so many words, it has treated the department either as a legal person or as something in between a legal person and a natural person. That, in my opinion, is not sound logic. Nor is there any legal basis for treating a Department of Government either as a legal person or as a natural person. In my view, the terms of S. 5(2)(a)(iii) show that it was an exemption granted to a particular function of the Government of India described by a certain name. And one might fell inclined to exclaim with the great poet Shakespeare \"What is in a name!\" It is but a description of the main purchasing activity of the Government of India, as the history of the department above set out shows.  \n30. Sometimes the language of a statute has to be construed in a modified form in order to give effect to the real intentions of the legislature where, as in the present case, the language is only of a descriptive nature and not a definitive one. An instance of this is furnished by the case of Miller v. Salomons ([1852] 7 Exchequer 475; 155 E.R. 1036, 1068). In that case the question arose whether a person of Jewish persuasion who was returned to Parliament as a Member of the House of Commons was entitled to sit without taking the prescribed oath. The form of the oath as given by 6 Geo. 3, C. 53, mentioned the name of \"King George\" only. It was argued on behalf of that member that the oath was confined to the name of a sovereign who bore that name. But it was held by the Court that it was a mere description and that the intention of the statute was to include all sovereigns who came after King George III. The relevant portion of the observations of the Court are in these terms :  \n  \"The second question arising on the construction of the Act is, whether, as the form of the oath given by the 6 Geo. 3, C. 53, mentions the name of King George only, the obligations to administer it ceased with the reign of that Sovereign, because it was applicable to no other than to him. I think this argument cannot prevail. It is clear that the legislature meant the oath to be taken always thereafter, for the enactment is general - that it shall be taken without limit of time - and the oath is not confined to the existing monarch, but mentions 'the successors'; and as it could not be taken in those words during the reign of a Sovereign not of the name of George, it follows that the name George is merely used by way of designating the existing Sovereign; and the oath must be altered from time to time in the name of the Sovereign, in the manner it was when actually administered in this case, in order to carry the obvious meaning of the enactment into effect. This is an instance in which the language of the legislature must be modified, in order to avoid absurdity and inconsistency with its manifest intentions\".  \n31. The High Court referred to the observations of Lord Halsbury in the case of Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Forest ([1890] 15 A.C. 334), to the effect that exemptions from taxation should be strictly construed because otherwise the burden of taxation will fall on other members of the community. Those observations, in my opinion, have no relevance to the facts and circumstances of the present controversy, because we know that the exemption was granted to the Government of India in the department dealing with purchase of certain commodities and articles without reference to quantity. As already pointed out, the Indian Stores Department was concerned with purchase of stores for public services on behalf of all Central Departments of Government and local Government, etc., and the Government of Bengal as then constituted was one of the Provinces of India which have been receiving subsidies and subventions to make up the deficit in their budgets. As a matter of fact, as stated on behalf of the Bengal Government the concession was granted in order to enable business communities within the Province of Bengal to compete on favourable terms with others outside Bengal in the matter of supplying the needs of the Government. Hence there is no question of liberal construction of the exemption resulting in throwing a greater burden on other citizens. On the other hand, the larger the sales in the Province of Bengal as it used to be, the greater the benefit to the business community doing business within that Province. It was therefore stated at the Bar that though the present case involved taxes amounting to less than Rs. 10,000, the question arising for determination in this case affected much larger amounts because such sales within the Province amounted to several crores. I should have thought that the business community in the Province of Bengal having had the advantage of the transactions of sale, the Government of Bengal in all fairness should have allowed the purchasing agency of the Government of India the benefit of the exemption until that benefit was in terms withdrawn some time in the beginning of 1949.  \n32. The matter can be looked at from another point of view also. We are concerned here with the sale of hessian. As pointed out in the affidavit filed on behalf of the Government of India, the purchase of hessian has all along been the concern of the Supply Department, now incorporated in the Ministry of Industry & Supply. Sales tax is a tax on sale of goods and tax on hessians falls within the contemplation of the law granting the exemption if the sales were effected through the purchasing agency of the Government of India. The beneficiary certainly was not an amorphous body like a department but the Government of India, because it is the Government of India which could be a unit for purposes of the Act.  \n33. In this connection our attention was invited to the last clause of the exemption covered by the words \"and any Railway or water transport administration\". The argument was that if the Government of India as such was to be the beneficiary, then there was no necessity for the words just quoted. But this argument overlooks the fact that a railway or a water transport administration need not necessarily be a Department of Government because there were, and still are, railway systems or water transport systems which are owned and administered by corporate bodies other than the Government of India. Sales even to those public or semi-public bodies were within the terms of the exemption. Those words therefore are not words of limitation but words which widen the scope of the exemption in so far as the same may be available to railways and water transport administrations not owned and carried on by the Government of India.  \n34. Another reason which may be adduced in answer to the contention that there was nothing to prevent the Legislature from stating that the exemption was granted in respect of all purchases by the Government of India is that the Indian Stores Department and its later substitutes had to make purchases not only for the Government of India, but also for local governments and other public bodies. Hence the exemption in the terms in which it occurs in section 5(2)(a)(iii) was not an exemption in favour of the Government of India only but also to other Governments and public bodies which could avail themselves of the facility of purchase through that department.  \n35. Another argument was urged to meet the appellant's case that really the exemption was meant for the Government of India in its function of purchase of stores and commodities, discharged through the Indian Stores Department and later through the Supply Department. It was argued that if the legislature meant to grant the exemption to the Government of India, then the easiest thing to do would have been to say that sales to the Government of India were exempt from the tax. But it has not been the contention of the appellant that all sales to the Government of India are within the terms of the exemption. Only the sales transacted through the purchasing department of the Government of India were so exempt. In para. 7 of the affidavit referred to above it has been stated on behalf of the Government that the different departments were entitled to make local purchases of small values, that is to say, not exceeding Rs. 100 and of certain specified commodities like foodstuffs which were not within the purchasing activity of the departments aforesaid of the Government of India. Hence, in my opinion, there is no validity in this argument either.  \n36. It was also suggested during the argument that if the exemption were to be related to only such commodities and articles as were within the purview of the Stores Department and later of the Supply Department, then such an interpretation would involve addition of qualifying words to the section which is not ordinarily within the function of the courts. But, in my opinion, this argument also suffers from the infirmity that it equates the departments mentioned in the exemption clause quoted above with a legal person, - an argument which has already been dealt with. In my opinion, there is no escape from the conclusion that those are mere words of description and are not words with defined connotation, because neither the Act nor the rules framed thereunder define those departments. If the nomenclature only mattered, then there is no escape from the conclusion that whatever articles and commodities were purchased by the Indian Stores Department or its later substitutes, of whatever magnitude and value, would be within the mischief of the exemption clause in question. But that, in my opinion, was not the intention of the framers of the Act. They knew what the activities of the Government through those departments were and the exemption was granted only in respect of those functions of the Government, as already indicated.  \n37. For the aforesaid reasons I would allow these appeals, set aside the orders of the Letters Patent Bench and restore the orders passed by the Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court, with costs throughout.  \n38.                        By the court. \n39. In accordance with the judgment of the majority the appeals are dismissed with costs.  \n"}, {"id": "1171368", "date": "12/1955", "tagline": "Minister Of National Revenue vs Anaconda American Brass Ltd. on 13 December, 1955", "judgment": "Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

This appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, which dismissed an appeal from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, raises a question of novelty and importance. The appellant is the Minister of National Revenue, the respondent a limited company, Anaconda American Brass Ltd. \n2. The Minister, on the assessment of the respondent company to income- tax and excess profits tax for the year 1947, increased the amount of taxable income declared by the company by the sum of $1,611,756.43, with the result that its excess profit tax for that year was increased by about $241,000 and its income-tax by about $483,000. Against this assessment the company appealed to the Exchequer Court : the President of the court allowed the appeal and, as already said, the Supreme Court dismissed the Minister's appeal from his judgment. It is only the excess profits tax with which this appeal is concerned. \n3. The excess profit tax is levied under the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, which by section 3 provides that in addition to any other tax or duty payable under any Act there shall be assessed, levied and paid a tax in accordance with the rate set out in the Second Schedule thereto upon the excess profits of every corporation or joint stock company residing or ordinarily resident in Canada or carrying on business in Canada. The rate set out in the Second Schedule is 15 per cent, of the excess profits in the case of corporation or joint stock companies. \"Profits\" in their case is by the same Act defined to mean for any taxation period the amount of net taxable income for the same period as determined under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act. Under the latter Act income is, so far as is relevant, defined as meaning the annual net profit or gain ascertained and capable of computation as being the profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business. \n4. The question, then, is whether the Minister correctly assessed the annual net profit or gain of the company for the year 1947 or, to state the question more accurately, whether the company has established that his assessment was incorrect. \n5. The material facts of the case are not in dispute. \n6. The company carries on the business of purchasing metals, manufacturing them into sheets, rods and tubes and selling the manufactured metals. About 98 per cent. of the metals purchased by the company consist of copper (over 80 per cent.) and zinc (about 15 per cent.). The other principal metals are lead, tin and nickel. The prices which the company charges for its products are closely related to the prices paid by it to replace the metals used in manufacturing its products, and, when market prices of purchased metals are increased, it at once correspondingly increases the prices of its products. \n7. The company is constantly purchasing metals to replace those that are being used. Its practice is to make an estimate at the beginning of each month of the quantity of metals which will be used during the next month and to order from its suppliers the same quantity to replace such metals. It maintains an inventory or stock of metals at all times of about one-third to one-quarter of its annual requirements, so that it turns over its inventory three or four times a year. About two-thirds of the copper and zinc inventory is continuously in process in the plant : this indicates that the average time in process is about eight weeks. \n8. The company did not keep records from which the actual metals used during the year could be identified or the amounts paid for those metals determined. But it kept records of the quantities of metals (a) in its inventory at the beginning of the year, (b) purchased during the year, and (c) in its inventory at the end of the year. It also kept records of the prices paid for the metals purchased from time to time. \n9. Thus in the year 1947 the company knew what stock it had in hand at the beginning, what stock it had purchased during the year, and what stock it had in hand at the end of it. It also know what prices it had paid during the year for the metals it purchased. But it did not know and could not ascertain either in respect of all the metals which it used during the year what price had been paid for them or in respect of all the metals which it had at the end of the year what price had been paid for them. Yet in order to determine its annual profit or gain for the year 1947 it is necessary to ascribe the proper cost to the metals used and the proper cost or value to the metals remaining in stock. In the absence of knowledge an assumption or estimate must be made and it is at this stage that the difference between the parties arises. \n10. It is convenient first to explain the manner in which the company made up its return for the year 1947, stating only by way of premise that, whereas the prices of raw materials had for some time before that year, been comparatively stable, in that year, as the result of the relaxation and then the removal of war-time controls, there had been large increases of price, for example, of copper on January 22 from 11.5 cents per Pound to 16.625 cents per Pound and on June 10 to 21.5 cents per Pound. It was under these circumstances that in 1947 for the first time the company made a return for income-tax purposes in which a system known as Lifo, or last-in-first-out, was adopted. It was a system which it had used for its own corporate purposes for some time previously in respect of copper, but neither it nor any other taxpayer in Canada had adopted it for taxation purposes. It must now be briefly explained. \n11. It must in the first place be explained that Lifo does not mean that the metal last to be received into stock is in fact the first to be processed and sold. On the contrary, the actual physical flow of the raw material is regarded as irrelevant : that which was purchased in previous years and was in stock at the opening of the relevant financial year or that which was purchased during that year may have been processed and the products sold during that year : this is of no account. It is to cost that Lifo looks, and in the simplest terms it means that the cost per pound of the metal most recently purchased and added to stock is the cost per pound of metal content to be charged against the next sale of processed metal products. It is the necessary corollary of this that to the stock which is in fact in hand at the end of the year there must be attributed the cost of metal which has not yet been exhausted by the cost attributed to metal consumed; this has been called the unabsorbed residue of cost. Thus in the case under appeal the stock of copper in hand at the close of the year 1947 (the \"closing inventory\" as it is conveniently called) consisted of 14,291,007 Pounds : and under the Lifo system it was treated as follows : \n(a) 6,500,000 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 7.5 cents per Pound (the average cost of the copper in the inventory when Lifo was adopted in 1936) amounting to $487,500 \n \n\n(b) 802,697 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 9.466 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1936) amounting to $75,983.30; \n(c) 17,577 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.191 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1937) amounting to $1,967.04; \n(d) 639,807 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 10.443 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1938) amounting to $66,847.04; \n(e) 973,477 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.036 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1939) amounting to $107,432.92; \n(f) 3,151,684 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.5 cents per Pound (the price paid in 1945) amounting to $362,443.66; \n(g) 2,205,765 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.5 cents per Pound (the price paid in 1946) amount to $253,662.97.  \n12. The total cost of the 14,291,007 Pounds of copper in the closing inventory was thus assumed to have been $1,355,836.93, and this was the figure attributed to the closing inventory in the return for income-tax. It is to be observed that the price attributed by the company to nearly half its inventory was 7.5 cents per Pound, a price less than any price prevailing since 1935. The result is obvious. By attributing the higher cost to the metals processed and the lower cost to those retained in stock the company was able to show far lower profits than if it had followed the accustomed and traditional method of return. The question is whether the new method is permissible for income-tax purposes. \n13. It is necessary to emphasize the words \"for income-tax purposes.\" For a large part of the argument upon this appeal and throughout the proceedings has been devoted to showing that in Canada the Lifo method is in certain conditions a proper and generally accepted method of accountancy and that those conditions are conspicuously present in the case of the appellant company. This was the view accepted by the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada and by the Supreme Court. It is accepted unreservedly also by their Lordships. \n14. The appellant Minister took the view that, however appropriate the Lifo method might be for the corporate purposes of the company, it did not truly reflect its profit for income-tax purposes. He accordingly increased the assessable income by the sum of $1,611,756.43. In doing so he adopted the method known as the Fifo or first-in-first-out method, which assumes that the metal first purchased is the metal first used. Upon this assumption the metal in stock at the end of the year 1947 was the metal most recently purchased and inasmuch as it appeared that during the year 1947 the company purchased no less than 63,268,555 Pounds of copper and more than 14,291,007 Pounds (the quantity in the closing inventory) had been purchased at the price 215 cents per Pound in the last three months of the year, he determined the cost of the copper in the closing inventory at $3,072,566.50. This figure may be contrasted with the $1,355,836.93 appearing in the company's return. \n15. At this point it is possible to define more closely the position of the parties. The Minister concedes that in fact used during the financial year must be made. He does not dispute that there may be in the closing inventory some metal which had been purchased in previous years. But he contends that the method which he was adopted attains more nearly the result postulated by Lord Loreburn L.C. in Sun Insurance Office v. Clark \"that the true gains are to be ascertained as nearly as it can be done.\" He urges that it is a principle of income-tax law which has been adopted from commercial accounting practice that the values of the stock-in-trade at the beginning and end of the period covered by the account should be entered at cost or market value, whichever is the lower, and he says that for this purpose the actual stock in hand must be regarded and its actual cost so far as possible ascertained, and that an assumption or estimate is necessary only so far as ascertainment is not possible. Upon this basis he says that the Fifo method more nearly than the Lifo method represents the facts, and supports that contention by reference not only to the large purchases of metal during the last months of 1947, which can hardly have been processed during that year, but also to the fact that the Lifo method involves the assumption of 6,500,000 Pounds of copper purchased in or before 1936 being still in stock at the end of 1947. He says, therefore, that his assessment has not been displaced by any evidence that the Lifo method more nearly represents the true income of the company. He is not contend that the company (or some other taxpayer may not be able to establish that some other method than Fifo more accurately represents the income for tax purposes where the raw material used is homogeneous and no substantial part of it can be identified. Nor is it necessary for their Lordships to determine whether some other method as for instance the \"average cost\" method, may not in some circumstances be properly adopted for tax purposes. What the Minister urges is that the Lifo method does not more nearly than Fifo produce the true income in the present case, and that is the question for their Lordships' decision. \n16. The company, on the other hand, contends that, inasmuch as the Income War Tax Act does not contain any definition of \"annual net profit or gain,\" nor any directions how profits or cost of sales are to be ascertained, these matters can only be determined by the application of ordinary commercial principles except where such principles are expressly excluded by the Act. It then says that it is a question of fact what are ordinary commercial principles and that the president of the Exchequer Court has found as a fact, and the majority of the Supreme Court has concurred in his finding, that the company's return had been made in accordance with those principles. The contention, in short, is that annual income for income-tax purposes is determined by accepted accountancy practice unless the Act otherwise provides, and that in the present case the President has found not only that Lifo was an acceptable accounting method but that it was the most acceptable method and that the method adopted by the Minister was not a Proper one. \n17. These contentions of the company have been, in their Lordships' opinion, rejected by the minority of the Supreme Court (Kerwin C.J. and Estey J.). The income-tax law of Canada, as of the United Kindom, is built upon the foundations described by Lord Clyde in Whimster & Co. v. Inland Revenue Commissioner in a passage cited by the Chief Justice which may be here repeated. 'In the first place, the profits of any particular year or accounting period must be taken to consist of the difference between the receipts from the trade or business during such year or accounting period and the expenditure laid out to earn those receipts. In the second place, the account of profit and loss to be made up for the purpose of ascertaining that difference must be framed consistently with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, so far as applicable, and in conformity with the rules of the Income-Tax Act, or of that Act as modified by the provisions and schedules of the Acts regulating Excess profit Duty, as the case may be. For example, the ordinary principles of commercial accounting require that in the profit and loss account of a merchant's or manufacturer's business the values of the stock-in-trade at the beginning and at the end of the period covered by the account should be entered at cost or market price, whichever is the lower; although there is nothing about this in the statutes.\" For many years before and ever since this decision what is to be valued at the beginning and end of the accounting period has for tax purposes been taken to be the actual stock so far as it can be ascertained. It is in fact, so far as tax law is concerned, a novel and even revolutionary proposal that the physical facts should even where they can wholly or partly be ascertained be disregarded for the purpose of the opening and closing inventory and a theoretical assumption made which is based on a supposed \"flow of cost\" and an \"unabsorbed residue of cost.\" An expert witness called for the company observed that he did not imagine any of the company's witness would claim for a minute that there was a quantity of metal then on hand acquired in the year 1936 equal to the quality which was valued at the then cost. Yet there was no less than six and a half million pounds of copper in the 1947 closing inventory to which the 1936 cost was ascribed. He might have added that year by year the same thing would happened so long as the business went on and existing stocks were not seriously diminished : in 1987 as in 1947 the closing inventory would carry stock to which 1936 costs would be ascribed. This illustrates clearly the Lifo method which and shows how far it has travelled from the conception which has prevailed in the assessment of income for tax purposes. \n18. It was strongly pressed by the respondent that in dealing with homogeneous material the actual user test, if it could be applied by identification of parcels purchased at varying prices, would lead to capricious and illogical results. Assuming that this is so and that actual user should not in some cases be regarded as the final test, this does not in their Lordship's opinion establish the case for Lifo. It might be that in such cases, properly be adopted, for that method, like the Fifo method, brings into the account the cost of every purchase in its order. But the present case shows that under the Lifo method, if the business continues and stock is carried forward, substantial purchases may never come into the profit account at all. \n19. Their Lordships do not question that the Lifo method or some variant or it may be appropriate for the corporate purposes of a trading company. Business men and their accountant advisers must have in mind not only the fiscal year with which alone the Minister is concerned. It may well be prudent for them to carry in their books stocks valued at a figure which represents neither value nor its actual cost but the lower cost at which similar stock was brought long ago. A hidden reserve is thus created which may be of use in future years. But the Income-Tax Act is not in the year 1947 concerned with the years 1948 or 1949 : by that time the company may have gone out of existence and its assets been distributed. Seventy years ago Lord Herschell said in resell surplus by which the receipts from the trade or business excess the expenditure necessary for the purpose of earning those rejects.\" This is only one of many judicial observations in which it is implicit that no assumption need be made unless cannot be ascertained, and then only to the extent to which they cannot be ascertained. There is no room for theories as to flow of costs, nor is it legitimate to regard the closing inventory as an unabsorbed residue of costs rather than as a concrete stock of metals awaiting the day of process. It is in their Lordship's opinion the failure to observe, or perhaps it should be said, the deliberated disregard of, facts which can be ascertained and must have their proper weight ascribed to them, which vitiates the application of the Lifo method to the present case. It is the same consideration which makes it clear that the evidence of export witness, that the Lifo method is a generally acceptable, and in this case the most appropriate, method of accountancy, is not conclusive of the question that the court has to decide. That may be found as a fact by the Exchequer Court and affirmed by the Supreme Court. The question remains whether it conforms to the prescription of the Income-Tax Act. As already indicated, in their Lordships' opinion it does not. \n20. The history of the adoption of the Lifo method in Canada by the company and presumably by other companies is of some interest. The method appears to have originated in the U.S.A. and there to have been adopted by an American corporation which was the parent of the respondent company some time before 1938. But it was only by an amendment of the existing revenue law that it was in that year permitted to be adopted for tax purposes. In 1939 further amendments were made and the method is now permitted subject to statutory conditions which are summarized in the judgment of Estey J. in the Supreme Court. The many different which exist between the revenue laws of the U.S.A. and Canada do not permit too much weight to the fact that it is sought to do in Canada without legislation what in the U.S.A. is only permissible with statutory safeguards. But it at least supports the view that theories of accountancy, though they may be accepted and put into practice by business men, do not finally determine a trading company's income for tax purposes. Again, though their Lordships recognize that this appeal must be determined by reference to Canadian law, they notice that in the U.S.A., in a case in which the so - called \"base stock\" method was under discussion, Brandeis J. used words which are apt to describe the Lifo method also. \"In years of rising price, the \"base stock\" method causes an understatement of income; for it disregards the gains actually realized through liquidation of law price stock on a high price market... This method may, like many reserves which business men set up on their books for their own purposes, serve to equalize the results of operations during a series of years...\" : see Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co. 1. In this passage the distribution is nicely made between what is permitted for tax purposes and what prudent business men may think fit to do. \n21. So, also, in the United Kingdom an attempt has been vainly made to uphold the base stock method for income-tax purposes. In the recent case of Patrick v. Broadstone Mills Ltd. 2 Singleton L.J., in words that are equally apt if applied to the Lifo method, declined to accept the base stock method as conformable to income tax law, though it might be approved by accountancy practice. \n22. In the result Lordships are of opinion that this appeal must be allowed, the judgments of the appeal of the respondent company from the Minister's assessment rejected, and they will humbly advise Her Majesty accordingly. They repeat that they have reached this conclusion not because they dissent from any finding of fact by the President of the Exchequer Court, of whose lucid and exhaustive judgment no criticism can from this aspect fairly be made, but because his findings of fact do not offer a complete solution of the question. \n23. The respondent company must pay the costs of this appeal and of the proceedings in the courts of Canada. \n"}, {"id": "718964", "date": "12/1955", "tagline": "Aher Raja Khima vs The State Of Saurashtra on 22 December, 1955", "judgment": "           PETITIONER:\nAHER RAJA KHIMA\n\n\tVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nTHE STATE OF SAURASHTRA.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n22/12/1955\n\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nBENCH:\nBOSE, VIVIAN\nAIYYAR, T.L.

Travancore Taxation on\nIncome\t(Investigation\tCommission) Act, 1124  (Act  XIV  of\n1124)  modelled on the Indian Act XXX of 1947 was passed  by\nthe Travancore Legislature, to provide for an  investigation\ninto matters relating to taxation on income.  In July 1949 ,\nthe  United State of Travancore and Cochin was brought\tinto\nexistence as a result of integration between the two States.\nAll existing laws of Travancore were to continue in force by\nvirtue of Ordinance I of 1124 which was later enacted as Act\nVI of 1125.  In November 1949 the Government of the  'United\nState of Travancore-\n1197\nCochin issued orders under s. 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV\nof 1 124 referring the cases of the petitioner for the years\n1942 and 1943 (called Evasion Cases Nos. 1 & 2 of 1125)\t for\ninvestigation  by  the Travancore  Income-Tax  Investigation\nCommission.  Before the Commission could make its report the\nConstitution  of India came into force and the United  State\nof  Travancore-Cochin became a part of India (Part B  State)\nand  the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 was continued  in  force\nuntil altered, amended or repealed by a competent authority.\nIn  April 1950 Parliament passed Act XXXIII of 1950  whereby\nTaxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, (Act\t XXX\nof  1947) was extended to Travancore-Cochin and the  law  of\nTravancore corresponding to Act XXX of 1947 was to  continue\nin  force  with certain modifications.\tIn October  1951,  a\nnotification  issued by the Indian Investigation  Commission\nappointed  Respondent No. 1 as an authorised official  under\ns.  6 of Travancore Act XIV of 1124 read with Act XXXIII  of\n1950.  Respondent No. I sent a copy of that notification  to\nthe  petitioner on 21st November, 1951 for  his\t information\nand further intimated to him that the investigation proposed\nto  be conducted will not be confined to the years 1942\t and\n1943  but that it would be necessary for him to\t investigate\nthe petitioner's income for the period from 1940 to the last\ncompleted assessment year.\nThe petitioner filed a writ petition in the Travancore\tHigh\nCourt against Respondent No. I and Respondent No. 2  (Indian\nIncome-Tax   Investigation   Commission)  for  a   writ\t  of\nprohibition  or any other writ prohibiting  the\t Respondents\nfrom holding an enquiry into the cases registered as Evasion\nCases  Nos. 1 & 2 of 1126 or from holding  an  investigation\ninto the income of the petitioner from the year 1940 to\t the\nlast  completed assessment year.  The Travancore High  Court\nheld  that the Respondent No. 2 had all the powers that\t the\nTravancore  Commission had under Travancore Act XIV of\t1124\nand  no\t more and granted the writ  prohibiting\t respondents\nfrom  conducting an enquiry into years other than  1942\t and\n1943.\tBoth  the  parties appealed  to\t the  Supreme  Court\nagainst\t the  order  of\t the  High  Court.   A\t preliminary\nobjection to the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain\nthe  writ petition was repeated in the Supreme Court by\t the\nAttorney-General.\nHeld, that the High Court bad jurisdiction under Art. 226 of\nthe  Constitution to issue a writ against Respondent  No.  1\nbecause\t under the provisions of s. 6 of the Travancore\t Act\nXIV  of 1124 the authorised official (Respondent No. 1)\t had\nconsiderable powers conferred upon him in the conduct of the\ninvestigation, and if he did anything as authorised official\nwhich  was  not authorised by law or was  violative  of\t the\nfundamental rights of the petitioner as in the present\tcase\nbe  would be amenable to the jurisdiction of the High  Court\nunder Art. 226 of the Constitution.\nHeld,  further that under the provisions of  the  Travancore\nAct  XIV  of  1124  the\t Commission  had  no  authority\t 'to\ninvestigate  any case suo motu.\t It could  only\t investigate\ncases referred to it by\n1198\nGovernment.  All that was done in the present case was\tthat\nby  two\t separate orders made under s. 5(1) of the  Act\t the\nGovernment referred two cases of the petitioner for the\t two\nyears  1942 and 1943 to the Commission.\t There was no  other\norder  under s. 5(1) at any time before 16th  February\t1950\nand  none  could be made under that sub-section\t after\tthat\ndate.  Therefore neither Respondent No. 2 nor Respondent No.\n1   who\t had  been  appointed  as  authorised  Official\t  by\nRespondent No. 2 had jurisdiction to cover any period beyond\nthe  two specific years 1942 and 1943 and the  notice  dated\n21st November 1951 issued by Respondent No. 1 to investigate\nthe petitioner's income for the period from 1940 to the last\ncompleted  assessment year was clearly illegal\tand  without\njurisdiction.\nHeld,  also that s. 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV  of\t1124\nwhich  is  to be read in juxta-position with s.\t 47  of\t the\nTravancore  Inc6me-Tax\tAct,  1121 (XXIII of  1121)  is\t not\ndiscriminatory\tand  violative\tof  the\t fundamental   right\nguaranteed under Art. 14 of the Constitution.\nSection\t 47(1)\tof  the Travancore Act\tXXIII  of  1121\t was\ndirected only against those persons concerning whom definite\ninformation  came  into the possession\tof  the,  Income-tax\nOfficer\t and in consequence of which the Income-tax  Officer\ndiscovered  that the income of those persons had escaped  or\nbeen  under-assessed  or assessed at too low a rate  or\t had\nbeen the subject of excessive relief.  The class of  persons\nenvisaged by s. 47(1) was a definite class about which there\nwas definite information leading to discovery within 8 years\nor  4 years as the case may be of definite item or items  of\nincome which had escaped assessment.  The action to be taken\nunder  Travancore  Act\tXXIII of 1121 was  not\tconfined  to\nescapement  from  assessment of income made during  the\t war\nperiod\t(September 1939 to 1946).  Action could be taken  in\nrespect\t of income which escaped assessment even before\t the\nwar and also more than 8 years after the end of the war.\nOn the other hand under s. 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of\n1124  the  class of persons sought to be  reached  comprised\nonly  these  persons  about  whom  there  was  no   definite\ninformation  and no discovery of any definite item or  items\nof  income  which  escaped  taxation  but  about  whom\t the\nGovernment had only prima facie reason to believe that\tthey\nhad evaded payment of tax to a substantial amount.  Further,\naction under s. 5(1) read with s. 8(2) of the Travancore Act\nXIV of 1124 was definitely limited to the evasion of payment\nof  taxation  on  income  made during  the  war\t period\t and\ntherefore s. 5(1) of the Travancore Act XIV of 1124 was\t not\ndiscriminatory in comparison with s. 47(1) of the Travancore\nAct XXIII of 1121.\nElection  Commission,  India  v.

The High Court held\t (i)\nthat  the  charges  set\t out in\t the  application  bad\tbeen\nsubstantially proved and that it was a fit case for an order\nfor  winding  up being made under s. 162(vi) and  (ii)\tthat\nunder the circumstances action could be taken under s. 153-C\nand accordingly it appointed two administrators with all the\npowers\tof  directors  to  look after  the  affairs  of\t the\nCompany.  On appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court by\nthe Company it was contended that the\n1067\napplication under s. 153-C was not maintainable inasmuch  as\nthere  was  no\tproof that the applicant  had  obtained\t the\nconsent\t of requisite number of shareholders as provided  in\nsub-clause (3)(a)(i) to s. 153-C, that clause providing that\na  member  applying for relief must obtain  the\t consent  in\nwriting of not less than one hundred members of the  Company\nor  not\t less than one-tenth of the members of\tthe  Company\nwhichever is less.  It was alleged that thirteen members who\nhad given their consent to the filing of the application had\nsubsequently withdrawn their consent.\nHeld  that the validity of a petition must be judged on\t the\nfacts  as they were at the time of its presentation,  and  a\npetition  which\t was  valid when presented  cannot,  in\t the\nabsence of a provision to that effect in the statute,  cease\nto  be\tmaintainable by reason of events subsequent  to\t its\npresentation.  The withdrawal of consent by thirteen of\t the\nmembers, even if true, could not affect either the right  of\nthe applicant to proceed with the application or the  juris-\ndiction of the court to dispose of it on its own merits.\nHeld  further that before taking action under s.  153-C\t the\ncourt must be satisfied that circumstances exist on which an\norder  for winding up could be made under s. 162  and  where\ntherefore  the\tfacts  proved do not make  out\ta  case\t for\nwinding\t up  under s. 162, no order can be passed  under  s.\n153-C.\nThe  words \"just and equitable\" in s. 162(vi) are not to  be\nconstrued  ejusdem  generis with the  matters  mentioned  in\nclauses (i) to (v)  of the section.\nIf  there  is  merely  a  misconduct  of  the  directors  in\nmisappropriating  the  funds  of the Company  an  order\t for\nwinding\t up  would  not\t be just and  equitable\t but  if  in\naddition  to  such  misconduct,\t circumstances\texist  which\nrender\tit  desirable in the interests of  the\tshareholders\nthat the Company should be wound up, s. 162(vi) would be  no\nbar to the jurisdiction of the court to make such an order.\nThe order for winding up was just and equitable in the\tcir-\ncumstances of the present case.\nIn re Anglo-Greek Steam Company ([1866] L.R. 2 Eq. 1), In re\nDiamond\t Fuel  Company ([1879] 13 Ch.

Though they are not courts in the strict  sense\nof the term, they have to discharge quasi judicial functions\nand  as such are subject to the overriding  jurisdiction  of\nthe Supreme Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution.  Their\npowers\tare derived from the statute that creates  them\t and\nthey have to function within the limits imposed there and to\nact  according to its provisions.  Those  provisions  invest\nthem with many of the trappings\" of a court and deprive them\nof arbitrary or absolute discretion and power.\nBenevolent   despotism\t is   foreign\tto   a\t  democratic\nConstitution.  When the Constitution of India converted this\ncountry\t into a sovereign, democratic, republic, it did\t not\ninvest it with the mere trappings of democracy but  invested\nit,  with  the real thing, the true kernel of which  is\t the\nultimate authority of the courts to restrain all exercise of\nabsolute  and arbitrary power not only by the executive\t and\nby   officials\tand  lesser  tribunals\tbut  also   by\t the\nlegislatures   and   even   by\t Parliament   itself.\t The\nConstitution  established a \"Rule of Law\" in this  land\t and\nthat  carries with it restraints and restrictions  that\t are\nforeign to despotic power.\nThe courts, however, must always exercise caution and should\nnot substitute their own judgment and discretion for that of\nsuch tribunals.\n166\n1316\n   In  view of ss. 7 and 11 of the Industrial Disputes\tAct,\n1947 and U.P.

This appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, which dismissed an appeal from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, raises a question of novelty and importance. The appellant is the Minister of National Revenue, the respondent a limited company, Anaconda American Brass Ltd.  \n 2. The Minister, on the assessment of the respondent company to income- tax and excess profits tax for the year 1947, increased the amount of taxable income declared by the company by the sum of $1,611,756.43, with the result that its excess profit tax for that year was increased by about $241,000 and its income-tax by about $483,000. Against this assessment the company appealed to the Exchequer Court : the President of the court allowed the appeal and, as already said, the Supreme Court dismissed the Minister's appeal from his judgment. It is only the excess profits tax with which this appeal is concerned.  \n 3. The excess profit tax is levied under the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, which by section 3 provides that in addition to any other tax or duty payable under any Act there shall be assessed, levied and paid a tax in accordance with the rate set out in the Second Schedule thereto upon the excess profits of every corporation or joint stock company residing or ordinarily resident in Canada or carrying on business in Canada. The rate set out in the Second Schedule is 15 per cent, of the excess profits in the case of corporation or joint stock companies. \"Profits\" in their case is by the same Act defined to mean for any taxation period the amount of net taxable income for the same period as determined under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act. Under the latter Act income is, so far as is relevant, defined as meaning the annual net profit or gain ascertained and capable of computation as being the profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business.  \n 4. The question, then, is whether the Minister correctly assessed the annual net profit or gain of the company for the year 1947 or, to state the question more accurately, whether the company has established that his assessment was incorrect.  \n 5. The material facts of the case are not in dispute.  \n 6. The company carries on the business of purchasing metals, manufacturing them into sheets, rods and tubes and selling the manufactured metals. About 98 per cent. of the metals purchased by the company consist of copper (over 80 per cent.) and zinc (about 15 per cent.). The other principal metals are lead, tin and nickel. The prices which the company charges for its products are closely related to the prices paid by it to replace the metals used in manufacturing its products, and, when market prices of purchased metals are increased, it at once correspondingly increases the prices of its products.  \n 7. The company is constantly purchasing metals to replace those that are being used. Its practice is to make an estimate at the beginning of each month of the quantity of metals which will be used during the next month and to order from its suppliers the same quantity to replace such metals. It maintains an inventory or stock of metals at all times of about one-third to one-quarter of its annual requirements, so that it turns over its inventory three or four times a year. About two-thirds of the copper and zinc inventory is continuously in process in the plant : this indicates that the average time in process is about eight weeks.  \n 8. The company did not keep records from which the actual metals used during the year could be identified or the amounts paid for those metals determined. But it kept records of the quantities of metals (a) in its inventory at the beginning of the year, (b) purchased during the year, and (c) in its inventory at the end of the year. It also kept records of the prices paid for the metals purchased from time to time.  \n 9. Thus in the year 1947 the company knew what stock it had in hand at the beginning, what stock it had purchased during the year, and what stock it had in hand at the end of it. It also know what prices it had paid during the year for the metals it purchased. But it did not know and could not ascertain either in respect of all the metals which it used during the year what price had been paid for them or in respect of all the metals which it had at the end of the year what price had been paid for them. Yet in order to determine its annual profit or gain for the year 1947 it is necessary to ascribe the proper cost to the metals used and the proper cost or value to the metals remaining in stock. In the absence of knowledge an assumption or estimate must be made and it is at this stage that the difference between the parties arises.  \n 10. It is convenient first to explain the manner in which the company made up its return for the year 1947, stating only by way of premise that, whereas the prices of raw materials had for some time before that year, been comparatively stable, in that year, as the result of the relaxation and then the removal of war-time controls, there had been large increases of price, for example, of copper on January 22 from 11.5 cents per Pound to 16.625 cents per Pound and on June 10 to 21.5 cents per Pound. It was under these circumstances that in 1947 for the first time the company made a return for income-tax purposes in which a system known as Lifo, or last-in-first-out, was adopted. It was a system which it had used for its own corporate purposes for some time previously in respect of copper, but neither it nor any other taxpayer in Canada had adopted it for taxation purposes. It must now be briefly explained.  \n 11. It must in the first place be explained that Lifo does not mean that the metal last to be received into stock is in fact the first to be processed and sold. On the contrary, the actual physical flow of the raw material is regarded as irrelevant : that which was purchased in previous years and was in stock at the opening of the relevant financial year or that which was purchased during that year may have been processed and the products sold during that year : this is of no account. It is to cost that Lifo looks, and in the simplest terms it means that the cost per pound of the metal most recently purchased and added to stock is the cost per pound of metal content to be charged against the next sale of processed metal products. It is the necessary corollary of this that to the stock which is in fact in hand at the end of the year there must be attributed the cost of metal which has not yet been exhausted by the cost attributed to metal consumed; this has been called the unabsorbed residue of cost. Thus in the case under appeal the stock of copper in hand at the close of the year 1947 (the \"closing inventory\" as it is conveniently called) consisted of 14,291,007 Pounds : and under the Lifo system it was treated as follows :  \n (a) 6,500,000 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 7.5 cents per Pound (the average cost of the copper in the inventory when Lifo was adopted in 1936) amounting to $487,500  \n \n\n (b) 802,697 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 9.466 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1936) amounting to $75,983.30;  \n (c) 17,577 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.191 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1937) amounting to $1,967.04;  \n (d) 639,807 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 10.443 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1938) amounting to $66,847.04;  \n (e) 973,477 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.036 cents per Pound (the average price paid in 1939) amounting to $107,432.92;  \n (f) 3,151,684 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.5 cents per Pound (the price paid in 1945) amounting to $362,443.66;  \n (g) 2,205,765 Pounds were regarded as having a cost of 11.5 cents per Pound (the price paid in 1946) amount to $253,662.97.   \n 12. The total cost of the 14,291,007 Pounds of copper in the closing inventory was thus assumed to have been $1,355,836.93, and this was the figure attributed to the closing inventory in the return for income-tax. It is to be observed that the price attributed by the company to nearly half its inventory was 7.5 cents per Pound, a price less than any price prevailing since 1935. The result is obvious. By attributing the higher cost to the metals processed and the lower cost to those retained in stock the company was able to show far lower profits than if it had followed the accustomed and traditional method of return. The question is whether the new method is permissible for income-tax purposes.  \n 13. It is necessary to emphasize the words \"for income-tax purposes.\" For a large part of the argument upon this appeal and throughout the proceedings has been devoted to showing that in Canada the Lifo method is in certain conditions a proper and generally accepted method of accountancy and that those conditions are conspicuously present in the case of the appellant company. This was the view accepted by the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada and by the Supreme Court. It is accepted unreservedly also by their Lordships.  \n 14. The appellant Minister took the view that, however appropriate the Lifo method might be for the corporate purposes of the company, it did not truly reflect its profit for income-tax purposes. He accordingly increased the assessable income by the sum of $1,611,756.43. In doing so he adopted the method known as the Fifo or first-in-first-out method, which assumes that the metal first purchased is the metal first used. Upon this assumption the metal in stock at the end of the year 1947 was the metal most recently purchased and inasmuch as it appeared that during the year 1947 the company purchased no less than 63,268,555 Pounds of copper and more than 14,291,007 Pounds (the quantity in the closing inventory) had been purchased at the price 215 cents per Pound in the last three months of the year, he determined the cost of the copper in the closing inventory at $3,072,566.50. This figure may be contrasted with the $1,355,836.93 appearing in the company's return.  \n 15. At this point it is possible to define more closely the position of the parties. The Minister concedes that in fact used during the financial year must be made. He does not dispute that there may be in the closing inventory some metal which had been purchased in previous years. But he contends that the method which he was adopted attains more nearly the result postulated by Lord Loreburn L.C. in Sun Insurance Office v. Clark \"that the true gains are to be ascertained as nearly as it can be done.\" He urges that it is a principle of income-tax law which has been adopted from commercial accounting practice that the values of the stock-in-trade at the beginning and end of the period covered by the account should be entered at cost or market value, whichever is the lower, and he says that for this purpose the actual stock in hand must be regarded and its actual cost so far as possible ascertained, and that an assumption or estimate is necessary only so far as ascertainment is not possible. Upon this basis he says that the Fifo method more nearly than the Lifo method represents the facts, and supports that contention by reference not only to the large purchases of metal during the last months of 1947, which can hardly have been processed during that year, but also to the fact that the Lifo method involves the assumption of 6,500,000 Pounds of copper purchased in or before 1936 being still in stock at the end of 1947. He says, therefore, that his assessment has not been displaced by any evidence that the Lifo method more nearly represents the true income of the company. He is not contend that the company (or some other taxpayer may not be able to establish that some other method than Fifo more accurately represents the income for tax purposes where the raw material used is homogeneous and no substantial part of it can be identified. Nor is it necessary for their Lordships to determine whether some other method as for instance the \"average cost\" method, may not in some circumstances be properly adopted for tax purposes. What the Minister urges is that the Lifo method does not more nearly than Fifo produce the true income in the present case, and that is the question for their Lordships' decision.  \n 16. The company, on the other hand, contends that, inasmuch as the Income War Tax Act does not contain any definition of \"annual net profit or gain,\" nor any directions how profits or cost of sales are to be ascertained, these matters can only be determined by the application of ordinary commercial principles except where such principles are expressly excluded by the Act. It then says that it is a question of fact what are ordinary commercial principles and that the president of the Exchequer Court has found as a fact, and the majority of the Supreme Court has concurred in his finding, that the company's return had been made in accordance with those principles. The contention, in short, is that annual income for income-tax purposes is determined by accepted accountancy practice unless the Act otherwise provides, and that in the present case the President has found not only that Lifo was an acceptable accounting method but that it was the most acceptable method and that the method adopted by the Minister was not a Proper one.  \n 17. These contentions of the company have been, in their Lordships' opinion, rejected by the minority of the Supreme Court (Kerwin C.J. and Estey J.). The income-tax law of Canada, as of the United Kindom, is built upon the foundations described by Lord Clyde in Whimster & Co. v. Inland Revenue Commissioner in a passage cited by the Chief Justice which may be here repeated. 'In the first place, the profits of any particular year or accounting period must be taken to consist of the difference between the receipts from the trade or business during such year or accounting period and the expenditure laid out to earn those receipts. In the second place, the account of profit and loss to be made up for the purpose of ascertaining that difference must be framed consistently with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, so far as applicable, and in conformity with the rules of the Income-Tax Act, or of that Act as modified by the provisions and schedules of the Acts regulating Excess profit Duty, as the case may be. For example, the ordinary principles of commercial accounting require that in the profit and loss account of a merchant's or manufacturer's business the values of the stock-in-trade at the beginning and at the end of the period covered by the account should be entered at cost or market price, whichever is the lower; although there is nothing about this in the statutes.\" For many years before and ever since this decision what is to be valued at the beginning and end of the accounting period has for tax purposes been taken to be the actual stock so far as it can be ascertained. It is in fact, so far as tax law is concerned, a novel and even revolutionary proposal that the physical facts should even where they can wholly or partly be ascertained be disregarded for the purpose of the opening and closing inventory and a theoretical assumption made which is based on a supposed \"flow of cost\" and an \"unabsorbed residue of cost.\" An expert witness called for the company observed that he did not imagine any of the company's witness would claim for a minute that there was a quantity of metal then on hand acquired in the year 1936 equal to the quality which was valued at the then cost. Yet there was no less than six and a half million pounds of copper in the 1947 closing inventory to which the 1936 cost was ascribed. He might have added that year by year the same thing would happened so long as the business went on and existing stocks were not seriously diminished : in 1987 as in 1947 the closing inventory would carry stock to which 1936 costs would be ascribed. This illustrates clearly the Lifo method which and shows how far it has travelled from the conception which has prevailed in the assessment of income for tax purposes.  \n 18. It was strongly pressed by the respondent that in dealing with homogeneous material the actual user test, if it could be applied by identification of parcels purchased at varying prices, would lead to capricious and illogical results. Assuming that this is so and that actual user should not in some cases be regarded as the final test, this does not in their Lordship's opinion establish the case for Lifo. It might be that in such cases, properly be adopted, for that method, like the Fifo method, brings into the account the cost of every purchase in its order. But the present case shows that under the Lifo method, if the business continues and stock is carried forward, substantial purchases may never come into the profit account at all.  \n 19. Their Lordships do not question that the Lifo method or some variant or it may be appropriate for the corporate purposes of a trading company. Business men and their accountant advisers must have in mind not only the fiscal year with which alone the Minister is concerned. It may well be prudent for them to carry in their books stocks valued at a figure which represents neither value nor its actual cost but the lower cost at which similar stock was brought long ago. A hidden reserve is thus created which may be of use in future years. But the Income-Tax Act is not in the year 1947 concerned with the years 1948 or 1949 : by that time the company may have gone out of existence and its assets been distributed. Seventy years ago Lord Herschell said in resell surplus by which the receipts from the trade or business excess the expenditure necessary for the purpose of earning those rejects.\" This is only one of many judicial observations in which it is implicit that no assumption need be made unless cannot be ascertained, and then only to the extent to which they cannot be ascertained. There is no room for theories as to flow of costs, nor is it legitimate to regard the closing inventory as an unabsorbed residue of costs rather than as a concrete stock of metals awaiting the day of process. It is in their Lordship's opinion the failure to observe, or perhaps it should be said, the deliberated disregard of, facts which can be ascertained and must have their proper weight ascribed to them, which vitiates the application of the Lifo method to the present case. It is the same consideration which makes it clear that the evidence of export witness, that the Lifo method is a generally acceptable, and in this case the most appropriate, method of accountancy, is not conclusive of the question that the court has to decide. That may be found as a fact by the Exchequer Court and affirmed by the Supreme Court. The question remains whether it conforms to the prescription of the Income-Tax Act. As already indicated, in their Lordships' opinion it does not.  \n 20. The history of the adoption of the Lifo method in Canada by the company and presumably by other companies is of some interest. The method appears to have originated in the U.S.A. and there to have been adopted by an American corporation which was the parent of the respondent company some time before 1938. But it was only by an amendment of the existing revenue law that it was in that year permitted to be adopted for tax purposes. In 1939 further amendments were made and the method is now permitted subject to statutory conditions which are summarized in the judgment of Estey J. in the Supreme Court. The many different which exist between the revenue laws of the U.S.A. and Canada do not permit too much weight to the fact that it is sought to do in Canada without legislation what in the U.S.A. is only permissible with statutory safeguards. But it at least supports the view that theories of accountancy, though they may be accepted and put into practice by business men, do not finally determine a trading company's income for tax purposes. Again, though their Lordships recognize that this appeal must be determined by reference to Canadian law, they notice that in the U.S.A., in a case in which the so - called \"base stock\" method was under discussion, Brandeis J. used words which are apt to describe the Lifo method also. \"In years of rising price, the \"base stock\" method causes an understatement of income; for it disregards the gains actually realized through liquidation of law price stock on a high price market... This method may, like many reserves which business men set up on their books for their own purposes, serve to equalize the results of operations during a series of years...\" : see Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co. 1. In this passage the distribution is nicely made between what is permitted for tax purposes and what prudent business men may think fit to do.  \n 21. So, also, in the United Kingdom an attempt has been vainly made to uphold the base stock method for income-tax purposes. In the recent case of Patrick v. Broadstone Mills Ltd. 2 Singleton L.J., in words that are equally apt if applied to the Lifo method, declined to accept the base stock method as conformable to income tax law, though it might be approved by accountancy practice.  \n 22. In the result Lordships are of opinion that this appeal must be allowed, the judgments of the appeal of the respondent company from the Minister's assessment rejected, and they will humbly advise Her Majesty accordingly. They repeat that they have reached this conclusion not because they dissent from any finding of fact by the President of the Exchequer Court, of whose lucid and exhaustive judgment no criticism can from this aspect fairly be made, but because his findings of fact do not offer a complete solution of the question.  \n 23. The respondent company must pay the costs of this appeal and of the proceedings in the courts of Canada. \n"}, {"id": "1436728", "date": "12/1955", "tagline": "Thakur Pratap Singh vs Shri Krishna Gupta And Ors. on 2 December, 1955", "judgment": " *               *               *               *\n \n\n (c) that there has been any failure to comply with any of the provisions of clause (i).........\".    \n \n\n 12.
